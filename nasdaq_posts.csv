MindMed to be listed on Nasdaq! Time for a trip to the Moon üçÑüöÄ,"MindMed is a psychedelic medicine biotech company that studies how shrooms, LSD, and even MDMA and DMT can help treat depression. Honestly, I already confirmed their studies to be true in college.

Anyways, MindMed has been trading OTC in like Canada's market or something (I guess there are companies that exist outside the USA) so only brokers that allow OTC trading let you buy it. As of today though not anymore!

They announced that they will begin trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday, April 27, 2021 under the symbol: MNMD.

Reasons I invested:

1 To get in before Nasdaq listing (not too late to do so)

2 Always saw the psychedelic market to be the next drug market to boom (It still is relatively new market, more research and potential catalyst in the future)

3 I believe in the research (our generation is like number 1 in rising depression cases and most treatment for depression sucks. This research can be revolutionary for depressed apes that Yolo'd too many FDs or actual depressed apes that aren't retards.\[Edit: Other mental health issues they are studying to treat are; anxiety, addiction and ADHD\])

4 Kevin O'leary AKA Mr. Wonderful is invested in it (I usually don't buy into celebrity endorsements but Mr. Wonderful believes in the company and he doesn't invest in something he would lose money in. Also he did mention MindMed to Cathie Wood in a four panel interview on CNBC a week or two ago. So possible Cathie Wood interest after listing)

5 Nasdaq listing allows more money to flow in (after April 27 robinhood retards can throw YOLO money into it)

6 I like the Stock

The only disclaimer is that I am not a financial advisor and this would've been a YOLO post if I didn't lose so much money on stupid PLTR calls

Mods plz this is my first legit post here ever

edited a lil more info

Edit2: So there are people getting banned for mentioning the OTC ticker because its not 1b market cap. But it def is over 1b, sitting at 1.1b rn on Yahoo. Hopefully mods can see this and remove MindMed from the banhammer list and hopefully unban accounts that are trying to help people about the stock thx",2021-04-23 14:00:14

He will remain as one of the company‚Äôs largest shareholders, but will not have a say in how the company is managed going forward. Sources tell FreightWaves that the decision was Milton‚Äôs, in an effort to protect the company and his investment. Milton owns approximately 82 million shares or 20% of the company, worth about $2.8 billion dollars.

Milton is the founder of Nikola Motors, creating a vision for a hydrogen powered trucking industry. His comments about the capabilities of Nikola and the hydrogen powered trucking network he planned to build have occasionally stretched beyond what is physically possible, leaving many detractors to highlight these statements as proof that the company is a scam.

Others, including many in the industry and suppliers that partnered with the company, saw a firm with a grand vision and opportunity to make a major impact on the future of the transportation industry. If successful, Nikola could have a huge impact on the carbon footprint of one of the world‚Äôs largest source of emissions.

Before the company went public, few had heard of the company outside of the heavy-duty trucking industry. The company completed a reverse merger IPO or SPAC offering in June, which gave the company a valuation higher than Ford. The company has yet to mass produce a product and all of it‚Äôs revenue to date came from selling solar panel installation services to Milton.",2020-09-20 23:45:02
"I Think I Found A Way To Predict Dips with NASDAQ PSX and FINRA Volume, Or Maybe I Really Am Autistic","[Read Only Version of Google Sheet for Comparing Daily Price Change With Multiple Markets' Short Volume](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1emNB6-oMHNk42IaHpJ-67i5PL-Dg2OFblIp50zTH3PI/edit?usp=sharing)   \- Go Nuts Everyone!

&#x200B;

Last night I looked into SNDL and started comparing activities across the various markets that I could find, two for NASDAQ and FINRA's off-exchanges volumes. I sort of expected the relative volumes to be comparable in ratio, but they're not.

No, in fact there is some SERIOUS delay in tracking when markets start to swell up in short volume. If you look at Figure 1 you can see that they don't really seem to follow each other at all most of the time.

Except, when the different market volumes DO start to overlap and follow each other, THAT is when we see the larger dips in stock prices for those days!

&#x200B;

Now if you look at Jan 27th and Feb 10th in Figure 1 you'll see that NASDAQ PSX short volume peaked high, and FINRA and NASDAQ Boston synced up and peaked the very next day.

[Figure 1: Jan28th and Feb 11th were the largest dips, and also when NASDAQ B and FINRA short volumes started to sync up! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dj8tyjpqzg61.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=99aba3f5759d0272c401877acdef93cfea37e73d)

Yes, it is really easy with hindsight 20/20 to say ""OH YEA IT WAS IN THE DATA RIGHT THERE"" but I noticed something from another ""penny stock"" and made the same plot for the different volumes in the market.

[Figure 2: Same plot for different stock, showing similar trends as SNDL.](https://preview.redd.it/f5a16zi7tzg61.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=d631425582fb2593c9041ecc90805bdd2e231861)

Here, we again see the THREE DIFFERENT MARKETS dont usually line up, but when THEY DO START TO SYNC, the price has the largest dips the next day!

So if this is correct, than it's possible to see dip the next day **IF the NASDAQ PSX ShortVolume and FINRA Short Volume begin to move together** towards a peak. We'll see tomorrow, but I think this will show a drop tomorrow of over 20%

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Using only 2 data points(stocks) I was able to draw a trendline!
* If different markets start to sync up in volumes, the next day seems to have the largest dips in share price.
* IF my shit analysis is correct, than Boaty Stock is going to crash by over 30% tomorrow, MAYBE

**Edit 1:** Added the links to where you can find the volume txt files, but I've been having issues with the FINRA site, have to clear the browser sometimes or it takes you to a login screen.

&#x200B;

**Edit 2:** Was asked to see how my ""theory"" checks out with today's dip in TLRY:

[Edit 2.5: Updated the TLRY data out to Jan 11th, and HOLY SHIT! Only Time the 3 markets sync up and peak is when the price plummets!](https://preview.redd.it/h5yrk8dof0h61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7c89947359119453a375ee37a56578d524a18ed)

[Edit 2.75: TESLA, this janky ass theory seems to hold for TSLA?!](https://preview.redd.it/a01t7j8q41h61.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ae45aa3c1bccc557f410a210ff331bd4039297)

**Edit 3:**  BoatyMcBoatFace -4:30am 16% !!! 5am -13%, 9am -20%, 9:25am -13%, **10:30am -18%, Noon - 15%, 1pm - 15%, 2:45pm - 14%**

**Edit 4:** WELP.... -15%, I guessed 20% above, then 3 lines down I said 30%. Now gotta wait till 6pm to get FINRA numbers to see what the 3 volumes looked like.

**Edit 5:** FINAL EDIT, with all the market volumes falling. No idea what it means when they all dip still fairly tight like that, need to go through more data.

2. **Expanding 0DTE Options**: This move aims to bring the popular zero-day trading boom‚Äîcurrently focused on major indexes like the S&P 500‚Äîto individual stocks. It will allow investors to better manage portfolios and risks.
3. **Criteria for Stocks**: Only stocks with a minimum market capitalization of $700 billion and ETFs with a net asset value above $50 billion will qualify for these additional expirations. Companies like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and others meet these criteria.
4. **Challenges with Single-Stock Options**: Unlike index options, single-stock options are typically physically settled, adding risks for retail traders. Nasdaq proposes avoiding expirations coinciding with company earnings to reduce such risks.
5. **Market Potential**: While untested, demand for single-stock 0DTE options is expected to be high, based on strong trading volumes for single-stock options and investor enthusiasm.",2025-05-01 10:11:23

"""Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an unstoppable stock that could make you richer""","From an article yesterday on Yahoo Finance courtesy of Insider Monkey, the day before Ernst & Young resigns as their accountant and the stock drops by 1/3. The stock market lottery has a surprise around every corner. Long, short, whatever you want, there's a chance. If this convinced you to get back in yesterday, what a surprise was in store today.  


Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an unstoppable stock that could make you richer as it is developing high-performance server and storage solutions that are in high demand amid the artificial intelligence race and digital revolution. It is turning out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom as it makes computers that companies use as servers for data storage.

At the start of 2024, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) held just 6% of the worldwide server market. Selling liquid-cooled, high-performance servers for demanding computing tasks has allowed it to carve out a niche for itself. Because of this, Nvidia found Supermicro to be a perfect partner and provided it with top-tier data center GPUs to aid in producing dedicated AI servers.

Though not exclusive, its strategic partnership with Nvidia has strengthened its competitive edge in the server market. Super Micro‚Äôs revenue more than quadrupled from $3.6 billion in fiscal 2021 to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2024, coinciding with the generative AI market‚Äôs explosive growth. Additionally, its earnings per share (EPS) increased by almost ten times. More than half of its revenue now comes from AI servers.

The confirmation that Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is shipping more than 100,000 graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence underlines the strong demand that could translate into billions of dollars in revenues. Like other cloud service providers, Super Micro claimed to have recently installed over 100,000 GPUs with liquid cooling for some of the largest AI factories ever built.

The soaring GPU orders are one of the reasons analysts remain bullish about Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), with an average price target of $64.22, implying a 33.40% upside potential as of October 25, 2024. As per Insider Monkey‚Äôs Q2 2024 database, the company was in the portfolios of 47 hedge funds.

There were huge pools of collateralized loan obligations made up of junk rate covenant light leverage loans.Housing prices had outpace growth in income and rents by margins akin to 2005-7. The US government was running a $1T deficit during an expansion, and now it will run a $3.2T deficit.  


But stonks are booming. Even if this shit started to get cured tomorrow, we'd have major swaths shut down through mid-May, and a month of reopening. Unemployment is 12.7% in my state, headed to 20% by early May. Our unemployment insurance trust will run out in 6 weeks at this rate. State and local budgets are shot.  


But we've reinflated to what was already bubble levels. Why?  


All I can think of:  
1. The big risk before was corporate debt. The Fed is basically promising to buy into junk debt and ensure no one can fail.  


2. Because people know inflation won't kick off right away due to all the unemployment, they aren't afraid (yet) that 4-5% inflation turns basically every bond and fixed income security issued from 2009-2020 into negative real yield toxic shit.  


3. As more info comes out, 80% of tax breaks in the stimulus went to people with over $1M incomes. The 10% of households own 88% of all stonks, so they will do the best out of all of this. The rich can pump into the market because they know the government won't let it fail (this also means trillions are being pumped to make sure the top 10% get theirs, even if this means Social Security and Medicare are getting fucked). Fixed income was already shit low and with inflation it will become negative yield. Stonks will at least gain value some day.  


4. Institutions are desperately trying pair losses buying back in for a rally they know won't last.  


But still, I don't fucking get it.",2020-04-16 21:58:16

"This market is disgustingly overpriced, and we are due for a correction similar to what we saw during Dot Com/Global financial crisis.","I want to preface this by stating that I legitimately home someone can refute what I have to say here. I take no pleasure in the thought of people's 401k's and IRA's and pension funds getting absolutely decimated, and this post has nothing to do with politics... I think the market has been overpriced for a long time (+/- 8 years), and it is only getting worse.

**Some quick points:**

**1. Price to earnings ratio**

Price to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy. The S&P 500 is over 28 today, and before the market started correcting in February, we were actually over 31. The Nasdaq is at 37 and was as high as 44. While I imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what P/E means -- for those that don't -- here's a quick summary. For purposes of this post, let's use NVDA as an example. Assume NVDA didn't have a single penny in expenses. They didn't have to pay for employees. They had no rent. There was no salary for Jensen Huang, and they didn't have to pay a penny in taxes. They somehow got all their electricity for free, and they didn't even have a COGS (cost of goods sold) -- somehow they were getting all of their materials for free. Then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today... that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today, and they took 100% of that revenue, and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company. Right now -- NVDA's P/E is at 45.43 -- meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money.

The entire S&P is trading over 28 today... meaning if the +/- 500 largest companies in the USA didn't have a single expense, and continued generating the same revenue, it would take 28 years for investors to get their money back.

Who in the world would be interested in signing up for that ""investment"" opportunity? My own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and I wouldn't invest based on that return.

**2. The Buffett indicator**

The Buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the US stock market divided by GDP.

Historically, that number has hung out right around 1-- meaning the total value of the US stock market should be roughly the same as GDP. Buffett himself stated a value of 75-90% is reasonable, and a value over 120% signals the market is overpriced. The highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble, when it was 2.1 standard deviations above the trendline. The highest until now, that is. The market value is currently 211% of GDP, or almost 70% above what historically has been seen as normal.

**3. The stock market is insanely top heavy.**

The Mag 7 currently account for 31% of the S&P 500, and over 40% of the Nasdaq. If these 7 stocks correct, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the market as a whole. We saw this play out during Dot Com with the likes of Cisco, Intel, and Oracle. While the market was top heavy then -- it was nowhere near as top heavy as it is today... In fact -- the top 10 most valuable companies now represent more than twice as much of a percentage of value in the market as the top 10 did when Dot Com crashed.

Side note -- but I do think investors have briefly taken note of this. So much of these companies is based on perceived future growth based on revenue that can/will be generated by AI. But remember what happened when DeepSeek emerged last year -- and alerted WallStreet that an incredibly sophisticated AI can be created without pouring billions of dollars into R&D and infrastructure? The market absolutely tanked. What if it becomes obvious that these AI plays will not be unique to the largest tech companies in the world, and that these systems can be developed by any mid-cap with a decent budget?

**4. Home prices and the Housing Market**

I won't dive too deep into this, but homes are more unaffordable today than at any point in US history. Based on median US income and Median US home price, right before the Global financial crisis/mortgage crisis of 08/09 -- this number hit it's highest point in US history -- 45%.

Its highest percent¬†*until*¬†the last 12 months. It now takes over 46% of a family's income to purchase a home.  
30% is the figure that is generally regarded as affordable.

The condo market is collapsing, particularly in Florida, where HOA dues and Insurance costs have made these properties completely unaffordable.

Foreclosures on FHA loans are also set to resume. Biden put in place a policy where anyone that wanted could simply apply for a mortgage payment deferment after COVID... meaning call your servicer, say you're experiencing a hardship, and they simply give you a deferral. None of these homes could be foreclosed upon. They then tack these payments on to the back end of the loan with the additional accrued interest. This policy still exists today, but is about to come to an end in September. As of Q1 2025, over 10.6% of all FHA mortgages are at least one payment late. Over 4% of FHA mortgages are over 90 days late.

What happens when FHA foreclosures absolutely flood the market?

What does this do to home prices, and even more importantly, what does this do to homebuilders? If inventory skyrockets (more than it already has over the last couple of months), and price pressure pushes everything down due to increased supply, will home builders still be able to make money? Homebuilding employs over 11 million americans... Plumbers, electricians, roofers, landscapers, drywallers, framers, truck drivers, etc --

When homes stop being built, unemployment skyrockets, and GDP shrinks dramatically.

**5. Consumer debt is through the roof**

Credit card debt is at the highest it's ever been, and delinquency rates are as high as they've been since emerging from the global financial crisis. Q4 of 2011 was the last time delinquency rates were this high.

Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been in decades.

**6. Bonds -- worldwide -- are pushing higher and higher.**

The US is getting hit here worse than most, as it seems people are not excited about Trump's game of chicken with tariffs. Nonetheless -- you are seeing bond yields push higher and higher worldwide, as investors demand higher returns for government bonds to account for their perceived risk. Interest rates cuts have not quelled this. Despite 100bps cuts in the federal funds rate since last year, the 10 year t-note is actually up 80 ticks since then.

**7. Commercial real estate**

A massive amount of commercial real-estate will need to be refinanced in the coming 12-24 months -- and you will see these payments skyrocket. Many holders of Commercial real-estate refinanced their properties in the quarters after COVID, when interest rates were incredibly low. Most of these loans are either done on 5-year balloons, or as adjustable rate mortgages. These owners will see their payments jump by 30,50, even 70% as they are forced to refinance these properties and interest rates that are close to double what they were last time. This will be compounded by the fact that many companies moved to work from home models, or at least partial work from home models. Office space vacancy rates have skyrocketed -- meaning less tenants -- all while mortgage payments on these properties is skyrocketing.

**8. Student Loan Debt**

The government's moratorium on student loan payments has officially come to an end. 43 million Americans that have been been able to avoid making payments on their average of $38k in student loan debt for the last 5+ years are now going to have to start making payments. Those that don't will see their credit score be absolutely decimated. What other payments will the begin to fall behind on? As I mentioned previously -- credit card delinquency rates and auto loan delinquency rates are already high -- and rising. How much worse does that get when 15% of the population beings adding a several hundred dollar payment to their expenses each month?

There is a dozen other items I could list here, but in the interest of actually getting some work done today, I'll leave my post there.

I would genuinely love for someone to refute places I'm missing the mark, or why I may be wrong about my assumptions above.

"I think there is still a huge downside risk for the US stock market, despite the exemption for electronics","So, recently the Trump admin made an exception for electronics (e.g. smartphones, computers, etc.), so I wouldn't be surprised if we see the Nasdaq and tech stocks jump next week. That being said, I don't think it's enough to prevent a long term downward decline for US stocks (or the US economy in general), because:

1) Tariffs on other non-electronic items, which are used by people on day to day basis (e.g. clothing, food, etc.) have not been lifted yet. This will definitely still impact smaller and medium sized businesses.

2) Rising bond yields as governments and investors outside of the US sell their US treasuries, which could pose a liquidity issue if no one wants to buy US bonds

3) The reports of declining consumer confidence in recent months. The US economy is consumption based, and if consumers reduce their spending, that will pose problems for the economy. 

4) At this point, I don't think it matters what the Federal Reserve does. If they turn on the money printer with quantitative easing, inflation will likely go up, which hurts the average consumer. If they increase interest rates, this will raise rates on mortgages, car loans, and other loans, which will hurt already cash strapped consumers. The problems being experienced are due to fiscal policies, not a monetary policies. The Fed won't save you.

5) Donald Trump's mercurial nature makes it difficult for business both inside and outside the US to plan for the future, since tariffs can go on and off with a tweet. As such, spending will likely slow down since the future is too uncertain. Businesses outside the US in particular may simply choose to open up shop in other countries with a more ""stable"" business environment.

Long story short, unless the tariffs Trump has implemented are greatly scaled back (and other countries do the same in response), and he stops making policy on a whim, the US stock market is still in for some hurt. Of course, this is just my opinion. What do you think?",2025-04-12 12:51:25

"These calls could be 500 Baggers. Turn $1,000 into $500,000","Okay, I already know I'm gonna get a bunch of hate for this post, so I only ask that you read the entire  post  before replying. I honestly think this could be the biggest trading opportunity since Jan 2021.

In October 2021 $DWAC announced they were gonna merge with a brand new Donald Trump Media Company called Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). It's not just Truth Social but an entire company that will have paid video streaming, etc. Traders went crazy and the price shot up 1700% to $175. Then the SEC opened a lawsuit against them trying to block the merger and the stock crashed. After almost 3 years, the SEC finally cleared all the lawsuits and approved the merger. **$DWAC is holding a shareholder meeting on Friday, March 22nd to vote to approve the business combination. If the vote passes, the stock will change to ticker symbol $DJT as early as Monday, March 25th and make its public debut on the NASDAQ.**

**MAGA people are crazy.** When Donald Trump announced Trump NFTs they sold out within minutes. When he launched those Trump shoes they also sold out within minutes and are now selling for 10k+. 99% of the general public has NO IDEA a brand new Trump stock $DJT is going to be making its debut on Monday. Imagine Trump ringing the bell to the NYSE and pumping $DJT. And every news outlet in America covering it. Do you honestly think the MAGA people won't dump their entire 401ks, IRAs, etc and put everything into $DJT?

The daily volume right now is basically nothing, and when this gets mass media coverage when it turns into $DJT it may explode. And if you think Trump (who is gonna own most of it) is gonna dump his shares on everyone....he probably will....but there's a 6 month lock-up period. That means no insiders, including Trump, can sell any shares until 6 months of $DJT going public. It also has a 200% borrow rate going into the merger meaning any inflow of volume will make for a giant move.

Most new companies that go public don't have weekly options or any options at all. When Grindr went public it shot up 900% on the first day. A stock tied to Donald Trump Jr shot up 300% on merger day just because of Trump Jrs name. Yes they sold off later on but this is a trade not a long-term investment. $DWAC has weekly options because it's been around so long. All it takes is $DWAC going slightly above the old ATH and you can turn $1,000 into $500,000 with far OTM $90 calls. **This would be the best trade since Jan 2021. All it takes is volume coming from nationwide media coverage and MAGA cult buying and the trade will work.**

Here are my positions: March 28th $50, $60, $70, $80 and $85 calls -

I know 99% of you idiots won‚Äôt read this, but for the rest:

* Stock dropped 98% but is far from bankrupt. It just refinanced its debt and has $1.1B capital, $693M cash, enough to weather the housing market for two years or more.
* Company has been downsizing and focusing on unit efficiency the past two years, following the Carvana restructuring playbook.
* Made a billion dollars flipping houses in 2021, but is struggling in a frozen housing market. When Jerome Powell fixes the housing market Opendoor will start making money again.
* Has financing and staff to scale revenue by 3x, it's just waiting on the housing market
* Opendoor has been learning important things about how real estate works, like:
   * Real estate agents exist for a reason
   * Home prices go up in the summer
* Now that Opendoor knows how real estate works, it will make more money
* Opendoor is down in April because the hedge funds shorted it to kick Opendoor out of the Russell 2000. When the ETFs tracking Russell sell their shares on June 27 and the shorts cover, Opendoor will probably go back up to $2.

Click[ here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTNLPOVK7WborYt-Us1HThg1QCwyCbnJng1acrQAtoYa1iV6vd9-qFZZbdbU_SdEIbfFL9D98155zxk/pubhtml) for Opendoor‚Äôs financials in Google sheets.

**Change in business plan**:

Opendoor is a corporate home-buyer. They used to be in the business of buying homes at above market value, sitting on them a few months, then flipping them at a profit. This was a great business model in 2021, but not so good in 2022 when home prices stopped rising. Opendoor bought 35k homes that year, and ended up selling them for a billion dollar loss.

Since then, Opendoor has pivoted strategies, and now buys homes for about 10% less than they‚Äôre worth, then sells them at a profit. It‚Äôs actually a fair deal for customers: instead of paying 5% in agent fees and having to negotiate with buyers for months, they can pay 10% and skip the home selling process.

One problem though, is customers tend to overvalue their homes, so they tend to think Opendoor is overcharging them. A normal customer interaction goes like this:

1. Customer has a $500k house, and thinks it‚Äôs worth $600k
2. Customer goes to[ Opendoor.com](https://opendoor.com) and gets a quote for $450k
3. Customer thinks, ‚Äúhahahahahaha I knew these guys were crooks, they want $150k to sell my house, I‚Äôm selling with a realtor instead‚Äù
4. Realtor agrees Opendoor is a bunch of crooks, because realtor competes with Opendoor

It's been a truly terrible marketing funnel. Opendoor only converts 1% of its prospective customers at a cost of $14k per house.

The new business plan is this:

1. Customer goes to Opendoor
2. Opendoor says, would you like to talk to a local real estate agent?
3. Customer thinks, ""yes of course I don't trust you crooks""
4. Agent tries to convince the customer that Opendoor's offer isn't bad
5. If the customer sells, Opendoor wins. Otherwise, the agent sells the house, Opendoor collects a commission and still wins.

It's a much, much better business plan. Nobody wants to sell their house without talking to a real estate agent first, because they don't trust corporations. Now that Opendoor has figured that out, expect revenue to go up and marketing cost per house to go down.

**Opendoor no longer lighting as much money on fire**

Look at this chart:

https://preview.redd.it/f870nejv0p0f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ad9dc55bb34e1e364ac77fd85df1a0416af2723

Do you see where it says, profit per house, -$65k? That was the Zirp era. Home prices started going down, and the CEO decided he was going to buy even more of them at above market prices to capture the market. Thankfully, after lighting a billion dollars on fire, he and everyone else responsible got sacked.

They also laid off a ton of employees, cut marketing expenses, cut waste, etc:

https://preview.redd.it/z7p2prls0p0f1.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=04c6f5211988fe715b00d5c4fa391fb2efdd6e67

Now you might notice they're still losing money per every house they buy. Part of that is because they spend $14k on marketing per house they buy, which they'll hopefully fix by working with real estate agents instead of advertising straight to consumers. We'll get into the other reasons.

**Opendoor learns prices go up in the Summer**

Housing has an annual cycle. Prices go up in the Summer, and down in the Winter:

https://preview.redd.it/f824gu1tyo0f1.png?width=1994&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b90a8cbd312c38e374aaf42eb8f4c4d355c5ab6

Traditionally, Opendoor has been buying most of its homes in the Summer, because more people come to them to sell, so, why not:

https://preview.redd.it/63soyzu0zo0f1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=dac7fe4b5184f2baedb195d701de3b9f66008d23

Anyways, buying in the Summer is dumb because prices go down in the Fall. Not only that, but they take longer to sell which means more holding costs. Thankfully Opendoor finally figured that out this year, and promised to cut it out and buy more houses in the Winter and Spring instead. Expect more profit.

**Housing Market to improve, probably**

Back in 2020-2022, the housing market looked like this:

https://preview.redd.it/me4gb8kpzo0f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5091617ca516a8b4971af09502f87b767a0f849

And Opendoor ***made over a billion dollars*** in home-flipping profit, although important things like marketing, interest, and director salaries managed to eat up most of that:

https://preview.redd.it/c9nuqftuzo0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2fde5b351930e96c054192e5133932ac6feb232

Then interest rates did this:

https://preview.redd.it/uxmvhl9yzo0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b73632fed215ad8d78c53c879446244b68bd456e

And nobody could buy a home anymore:

https://preview.redd.it/7hvy9r610p0f1.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=a267029f52539e541af25bf4098d037ae6c84341

Home prices have been dropping:

https://preview.redd.it/hsm06i540p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5931c24ce3109d4ce9189094b014e2a68038921a

Which means Opendoor is paying millions in interest to keep $2B in homes on the balance sheet that are *depreciating*:

https://preview.redd.it/jy54y2p60p0f1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a36afec855753ace87e778f110b0d090c983ca

And the homes now take months to sell. Long holding times require maintenance and interest, which now eat half of profits:

https://preview.redd.it/wmn0sedc0p0f1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=56f664218157888a2d9e3d2a1af9407a27ad2e78

Fortunately, Trump says he's going to bully Jerome Powell into making 2-3 rate cuts this year so the US can refinance its debt, and that will hopefully maybe unfreeze the housing market. This will be huge for Opendoor. All the tailwinds we've discussed will start going in reverse: more acquisitions, home price appreciation, shorting holding times and lower interest costs. In short, more money.

**Opendoor to actually make money in Q2**

Q2‚Äôs estimates is for Ebitda profitability of $5-$20M, the first time Opendoor will make a quarterly profit in three years. 2025's housing market is even worse than previous years, so this means the business itself is becoming more profitable. Losses are still expected for Q3 and Q4, but they're expected to be smaller than previous years.

**Path to Profitability**

Opendoor lost $392M last year. Here‚Äôs how we get to adjusted net income positive:

* $80M: Opendoor laid off 300 workers in Q4, which saves $20M a quarter.
* $75M: My spreadsheet says Opendoor loses $12k per house they buy in Summer and Fall. They said they're going to stop doing this so that's $75M.
* $55M: They spend $4k per house more on interest and holding costs than they did in 2021. That's gonna be fixed because the housing market will improve and they'll stop buying homes in the Summer.
* $80M: Opendoor is starting to send customers that don't take their offers to real estate agents, which pay a referral fee. 1% referral fee \* 2% of 1.2M customers \* $330k average house price = $80M
* $130M: Housing appreciation. Opendoor has $2.2B in houses that have been depreciating at 1% a year. Should housing return to a historically normal 5% rate of appreciation, that‚Äôs $130M in profit.

That‚Äôs already $420M in savings, enough to be profitable. Revenue should also grow higher as the housing market unfreezes, and marketing spend should be more effective as they learn to partner with real estate agents.

**Debt Refinanced, cash to scale through next two years**

On May 9 Opendoor announced it had exchanged $245M in existing convertible bonds due in March for new convertible bonds due in 2030 at 7% rate, convertible at $1.57. Opendoor also issued $75M in new bonds, raising $75 in new capital. $135M in bonds is still due in 2026, but this will be easily payable with cash on hand.

Following the equity raise and bond refinance, Opendoor has $1.1 billion in capital of which 768M is cash (693M from Q1 report plus $75M equity they just raised). On the Q4 and Q1 transcripts management stated they had refinanced 90% of their credit lines through 2026.

Management has reassured us that they still have available cash and personnel to return to a much larger scale of operations. In the Q1 report they stated that only $350M of their cash is invested in homes, and they have $559M (probably $634M now) available to deploy towards home purchases. They are also only using $2B of their existing $8B credit line. From these numbers it seems they have the financing to purchase 3x more homes than they currently are. Management has guided that they are capable of purchasing many more homes, but they are choosing to purchase less while the housing market is slow and margins are low. I expect them to deploy this capital and scale in Q4, assuming mortgage rates start to fall.¬†

**Growing Short Interest**

This isn‚Äôt the first time the bears have shorted Opendoor, only to buy back their shorts at a loss when it turns out Opendoor isn‚Äôt dead after all:

https://preview.redd.it/xdvpvau91p0f1.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4e06e4325bf2b7efee5e90b28c4f3d0ea0bacc

The setup today is the same as it was in Dec 2022: the housing market is weak and everyone assumes Opendoor is dead, but it actually has years ahead of it and many tailwinds coming.

Chart from last month:

https://preview.redd.it/maq7tv7c1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=94560ccb30622d867dc6d39550747fdf46d7461b

From Nasdaq short interest we can see a net short position of 20M was added in the month of April:

https://preview.redd.it/sn7bk9mf1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=398ffff8aefed808010665a8ba234eb4211436a1

The price jump on April 7 was due to a good quarterly report, where the company projected it would be Ebitda positive in Q2 for the first time in three years. Two days later it fell on the news of the debt refinancing. Presumably the terms of the debt refinancing scared some investors: 7% bonds¬† convertible at $1.57, is expensive, and issuing them now when the stock price is so low might seem to some as desperate. On the other hand, this eliminates $245M in bond payments for next year and raised $75M in new capital. I view it as a positive development, as it extends Opendoor's runway and frees them to scale up purchases this winter. Without this debt raise, they wouldn't be able to fully deploy their capital in Q4 and Q1, since their cash would be invested in homes due to sell in Q2, and $400M was due in March.¬†

**Hedge Fund Russell 2000 arbitrage?**

Look at this chart again:

https://preview.redd.it/0id2wu3j1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c71de966368d3226cbb52398985c028d128fce8b

Note on April 23 Opendoor briefly rose above $1, then got shorted very hard in a coordinated action. There was a negative housing report that came out a few days earlier, but no news specific to April 23 and 24. Russel climbed 3.5% during this period and other real estate stocks climbed, but Opendoor fell 30% for seemingly no reason.¬†

One theory is this was an arbitrage move by hedge funds to kick Opendoor out of the Russell 2000. Ranking day was April 29, so any stock below $1 on April 29 will be removed on June 27. About 20M shares are held by iShares Russel 2000 ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/orb64bxl1p0f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf9b3acb1fb0f4b565590f03e77894d0cd2daf3e

20M net shorts were added in April, and 20M shares will be sold near the end of day on June 27 by iShares ETFs when the Russell 2000 is adjusted. Probably the shorts will cover on that day to make a nice profit. As a long-term investor, this is reason to believe Opendoor's current price is disconnected from its recent performance, since all the recent news coming out of the business has been positive. Given the stock's history in the last several years of wild swings, I wouldn't be surprised if it shot back up to the $2-$3 range after the shorts cover in June.

**Conclusion**

Opendoor is a stupid company that made over a billion dollars of home-flipping profit in 2021 when the housing market was good. Then their CEO lit a billion dollars on fire buying overpriced houses. He was fired and replaced with a responsible CFO. They've been learning important lessons: realtors exist for a reason, and house prices go up in the Summer. Now that they know these things they can make money. When Jerome Powell fixes the housing market they'll make even more money, and the stock will pull a Carvana and go up 100x.

Also, Opendoor just refinanced its debt so its very much not dead, they have over a billion dollars still, enough for at least two years, more if they fix their business as planned, or if the Fed fixes it for them.

Also, last month's price action was probably just the hedge funds shorting Opendoor to kick it out of Russell 2000 and abuse the poor etfs that will have to sell at a low price. I'm hoping the stock triples after the shorts close, probably on June 27.",2025-05-14 05:17:17
YOLO Life Savings into Puts on the Nasdaq,"For a long time I have believed that the AI hype was unfounded, due to its products being unprofitable. At the same time real estate is overvalued and thousands of homes are on sale for unsustainable prices. A move to AI is merely a cost cutting measure and will decrease jobs and thus spending power hurting the economy. Lastly the deficit is so high that a bailout is infeasible due to hyperinflation.

For these reasons I am $50,000 ALL IN on some sort of major market pullback.

The NASDAQ has officially entered a üåàüêª market!,"Yeup. That‚Äôs right. The NASDAQ 100 has a 52 week high of 16,212.23, which means the index would have to hit 12,969.78 in order to be 20% off of its all time high. As of right now, the index is at 12,874.61... it‚Äôs been pushing lower this afternoon as well. 

Edit: the NASDAQ 100, our beloved tech stonk index, closed today at 12,830.96. Even if you go by what the suits at douchebag central aka wallstreet prefer, which is a close that is 20% below the highest close, NASDAQ is still down 20%. On 11/19/21 the NASDAQ recorded its highest close which was 16,057.44, meaning a 20% drop would equate to 12,845.95.. so we barely made it by their definition as well, even if it was only 15 points below that threshold.

Is This Market Bounce a Trap? Rising Risks Could Signal More Downside (April 2025),"The market bounced last week.
But don‚Äôt be fooled ‚Äî this is classic fakeout territory.
Here‚Äôs why:

Historical Patterns After Crashes:
- In 2008, the S&P jumped +19% ‚Äî then collapsed another -28%.
- In 2000, Nasdaq bounced +40% ‚Äî only to plummet -70%.
- In 2020, a +10% bounce quickly turned into a -35% crash.
‚Üí Early recoveries are often just a setup for the next drop.

Today‚Äôs Risks (April 2025):
- Trump‚Äôs tariffs on China and global imports continue to rise, creating massive inflationary pressure.
- This will crush margins and slow growth, while keeping the Fed stuck.
- No rate cuts in sight ‚Äî just higher taxes and stagflation risks.
- Corporate earnings already under strain. Revisions getting ugly.
- Credit stress is rising. Spreads are widening.
- Retail is still all-in, buying this dip with no clear catalyst for recovery.

Bottom Line:
- History shows that first green candles after selloffs are headfakes.
- The market‚Äôs core fundamentals are weakening, not improving.
- This rally is probably just short covering and FOMO ‚Äî not real recovery.
- Real bottoms happen after fear ‚Äî not wishful thinking.

TLDR:
This bounce is dangerous. With rising tariffs, inflation, and collapsing earnings, the real risk is much lower, not higher.
Stay cautious ‚Äî don‚Äôt get trapped by the rally.",2025-04-27 14:34:27

In a new move to hinder China‚Äôs development of advanced semiconductor chips, the Trump administration has reportedly instructed U.S. companies that provide software used in semiconductor design to cease sales to Chinese entities, according to a report by the Financial Times on Wednesday. The directive was issued by the Bureau of Industry and Security, a division of the U.S. commerce department that supervises export controls.

The companies affected by this directive include Electronic Design Automation (EDA) groups such as Cadence, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS), and¬†Siemens¬†(ETR:SIEGn) EDA. It remains uncertain if all U.S. EDA companies received this instruction.

An official is said to have confirmed that the commerce department is currently evaluating exports of strategic importance to China. During this review, some existing export licenses have been suspended or additional license requirements have been imposed, the official reportedly added.

EDA software, while only comprising a small portion of the overall semiconductor industry, plays a vital role in the supply chain, enabling chip designers and manufacturers to develop and test next-generation chips.

The three companies, Synopsys, Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems, and Siemens EDA, collectively represent approximately 80% of China‚Äôs EDA market.",2025-05-28 15:46:07

Finally Hit $100k in Robinhood After Years of Grind,"First post ever on Reddit albeit a long one so buckle up fellow degens!
Been lurking for 6 years, finally made a new Reddit account to share this milestone. Started this journey back in 2017 in Robinhood, rode the highs and lows, and at one point even saw my portfolio drop to just ~$1K back in July 2022 (see screenshot #2) . But here we are in 2024, looking at ~$110k and up $47k (~76%) all-time! (Still quite can‚Äôt beat the benchmark yet; SPY‚Äôs got me outpaced in the long term ü•≤)

The Ups and Downs

Looking back, it‚Äôs been one heck of a rollercoaster. As you can see in my all-time chart, there were some major dips along the way. The journey wasn‚Äôt linear; there were times when I felt like the portfolio was just bleeding out, but I stuck with it, made some strategic moves, and kept adding funds whenever possible. 

After starting with the modest account balance of about roughly 18k back in Q4 2017, I steadily added funds to my portfolio over time, especially after seeing triple digit returns in NVDA, SQ and double digit gains in bunch of blue chip stocks; held some Chinese stocks like Luckin Coffee (before it got delisted from NASDAQ) . Got the account to a decent level.
Then went completely ‚Äòregard‚Äô and got into options üòÖ. Did well initially then hit the rock bottom reaching as low as $998 (see aforementioned screenshot #2). Added about 9-12k over next few months (see screenshot #3) to be able to trade again. No options but used margin money to almost double my account first. Then, as the bull market kicked in after bottoming out in October 2023, the account continued to rise. Later, I employed slightly more aggressive options strategies to reach my current position.

Key Moves 
The past 18 months have been all about- researching a shit ton (more!) and making mostly informed decisions mixing with some gut feeling, using Reddit (of course), stocktwits, yahoo finance, various research firms, reports, interviews, Fidelity, CNBC, etc

Current Portfolio includes: 
‚Ä¢	PLTR, bunch of Semi stocks including NVDA, TSM.
‚Ä¢	Blue Chips (duh!) 
‚Ä¢	Growth stocks like SOFI, SQ, 
 ‚Ä¢	ETFs and a few dividend/yield stocks like QQQ, IJH, XLE, JPEQ, etc. 
‚Ä¢	Credit Put Spreads, LEAPS, CSPs, and CCs
	‚Ä¢	PLTR and semi stocks, plus bluechi
Missed out on a 10x gain on NVDA (sold too early); funny enough never went long on TSLA or got into some of the group‚Äôs fav stonks from back in 2020-21 (you know which ones üí™üèΩ), but holding PLTR since 2020 has been solid.
I also hold stuff long term on other platforms- Fidelity and Webull including most of my PLTR shares. Can‚Äôt go full degen and YOLO everything just on Robinhood alone; you gotta diversify üò≠

NASDAQ and S&P bottomed out even if economy shows mounting signs of struggle? Obviously,"Before someone starts yelling 'tariffs this' and 'tariffs that', I need you to recognize that I'm not referencing the TOP. It's no surprise that the highest highs will need a materially different economic backdrop to even be approached for a while. 

The question regarding the bottom should be thought of within the context of 4 things:

1) Powell's rate cuts
2) Powell's successor's rate cuts 
3) USD weakness having a positive short term impact to businesses (long term is a different story)
4) NASDAQ/S&P 500 bottoms were based on peak trade war uncertainty, which will require further escalation to maintain the same effect, contrary to the extremely marginal, but nonetheless directional, improvements in uncertainty

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb,"I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: 

__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  

__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user ([u/zshub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/gl5vgof/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Also, someone else for over [$5,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7em07/coworker_had_a_limit_executed_of_a_little_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) per share. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation,"I have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

EDIT 0: Looks like I truly belong on this sub. On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.

EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.

EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.

EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.

EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

"$HITI Nasdaq, a long-term winning choice in its sector","The importance of buying young, great companies is something everyone knows, but few people actually do it or really care. The truth is that in the market you earn more by investing in young, transformative and disruptive companies, which offer unique services; they also must be capable of being leaders in what they offer and they must have proven this.

  
Large companies take years to build, or decades, and in the meantime the stock is subject to significant fluctuations for various reasons, rates at historic highs that weigh on valuations, wars, uncertainty, etc..

The key is to let the business grow, year after year, not by focusing on the stock, but on the continuous progress of the company's business, remaining invested for years or even decades.

To quote Buffet: ""The market is a system of redistribution of wealth, it takes away from those who don't have patience to give to those who have it""

As mentioned in the last call, margins will increase in the next year and I will cite some reasons that lead me to be sure of this:

* Constant growth in Elite membership (70% gross margin at current membership price of $3.50/month, expected to return to $5), I estimate they will exceed 100K by the end of the year (100k x5$/mounth = 500k/mounth + CCI + Fastlender technology license, all 3 with > 70% gross margin)
* Completion of Fastlender installations and license sale (high margin Saas model) expected in Q3
* The continued increase in market share in Canada and the reduction of competitors will allow HITI to increase prices and therefore gross margins
* Increase in white label products / elite inventory
* Recovery in demand for CBD products starting in Q4
* More favorable regulatory conditions in Canada
* Profitability achieved

High tide offers hundreds of items of different categories, and can boast of the best global brands.

* SMOKE CARTEL ‚Äì WORLD‚ÄôS MOST POPULAR ONLINE CONSUMPTION ACCESSORIES PLATFORM1
* DANKSTOP ‚Äì ONLINE CONSUMPTION ACCESSORIES PLATFORM (DankStop is one of the foremost online retailers of consumption accessories in the US)
* GRASSCITY - WORLD‚ÄôS OLDEST ONLINE CONSUMPTION ACCESSORIES PLATFORM

* FAB CBD ‚Äì LEADING US CBD BRAND
* NuLeaf Naturals ‚Äì AMERICA‚ÄôS PREMIER CANNABINOID COMPANY
* DAILY HIGH CLUB - The world‚Äôs number one stoner subscription box

The constant addition of high-quality properties will ensure a growing and constant flow of revenue. The fact that a store generates on average 2.3X the revenue of its competitor is a testament to the winning model that Hiti has.

With only 181 stores, out of over 3600 currently present in Canada (as of June 2024) Hiti holds over 10% of the market share, growing.

$HITI just reached 1.5M members in its Cabana Club loyalty program.

Since launching its discount model in October 2021, membership has increased by over 400%

High Tide is capturing market share every single quarter, both from competitors and illicit sellers.

In less than three years, the company's market share grew from under 4% to 10.9%, and it is well-positioned to reach 20% over the next two years.

**Pr :** [**https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-surpasses-1-5-million-cabana-club-members/**](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-surpasses-1-5-million-cabana-club-members/)

With the long-term goal of 300 stores, it is highly likely that the high tide will exceed 30% of the market in the long term, considering the continuous store closures due to margin battles and the constant increase in visibility of Canna cabana.

"The last time gold prices went this crazy, it didn‚Äôt end well","There was a prolonged 12-year-long bull market from 1999 to 2011. Every one of those years generated positive returns too (excluding cost of insurance.) Amid 9/11, Enron/Worldcom fraud, the NASDAQ crash, banking crisis, etc., gold prices climbed from $250 to $1,900 per ounce, with most of those gains squeezed into the last two years (1/1/2010 $1,110/ounce.)

4 years later, in 2015, gold prices had fallen to $1,050 per ounce, a 45% decline.

Now it‚Äôs going parabolic again ‚Ä¶ except there‚Äôs no financial crisis, or even an ordinary recession. There‚Äôs some instability with the tariffs. There are countries trying to reduce their exposure to US dollars. There are central banks that buy regardless of fundamentals. But these reasons still do not justify a 25% gain in 3 months.

The latest CPI was +2.4% from March 2024 to March 2025.

Exact numbers don‚Äôt matter, only where things are headed. Most of you are in the same miserable state that I am in, stuck flying coach. While we toil, gamble, and tuck our savings away into 401k and market funds, the tide is slowly rising against us.

Fast forwarding into the future and you can guess where this is going. All the profits are moving into private hands, where if you want to play, you get to join at the lowest tier. No more data will be available to you, and you will have to just trust that your share of the winnings is a fair one. The person handing you your portion has nothing to report, and you can take it or leave.

Private equity has no obligation to report anything, only that it exists and that it ‚Äúpays taxes‚Äù. But that‚Äôs okay, we don‚Äôt need dividends, right? Heck we don‚Äôt even need companies to be profitable, cuz we are all willing to bet high multiples valuation for losing companies. 

So you get those gains if you can, and then stuff it into your 401k, and it will still give something for now but will slowly deflate in the distant future.

PLTR: They said the quiet part out loud [DD],"On November 15, 2024, PLTR's board member Alex Moore tweeted,

>We are moving PalantirTech to Nasdaq¬†because it will force billions in ETF buying and deliver 'tendies' to our retail investors. Player haters be aware that we've been hated for decades (plural). Everything we do is to reward and support our retail diamondhands following.

Immediately afterwards, he deleted his tweet.

At first glance, the statement seems harmless, and even obvious. Companies are added/removed from passive indexes every day, and it's not a crime to want to deliver shareholder returns. There's no problem with boasting about passive index inclusion. It doesn't affect the fundamental business anyway.

Right?

I think otherwise.

Alex Moore said Palantir's quiet part out loud. I contend that this has been Palantir's gameplan since day one.¬†**The stock's performance**, ridiculous valuation, and mania all¬†**points back to one fundamental goal**¬†of the company's management:¬†**manipulating stock market indexes to juice valuation and provide liquidity for insider selling.**

**The Evidence (s/o Mike Green):**

**Part 1: The Listing**

Companies generally list via a direct listing, traditional IPO, or SPAC. For a company the size of PLTR, a SPAC was out of the question. They had to choose between an IPO and direct listing. Let's take a look at both.

**Traditional IPO**: Typically involves investment banks underwriting the deal, setting a price, and selling shares to institutional investors like mutual funds or hedge funds. Importantly, these shares are¬†**not**¬†part of the stock's free float, and insiders must dilute themselves in order to create new shares to sell on the public market.

**Direct Listing**: In a direct listing, a company offers existing shares directly to the public without issuing new shares or raising capital. This avoids traditional IPO underwriters (investment bank). The free float is immediately determined by shares held by insiders available to sell. Palantir chose this route.

**Takeaway:**¬†In a¬†**direct listing**, all existing shares held by insiders, employees, and early investors become eligible for public trading immediately. There is¬†**no lock-up period**¬†(common in traditional IPOs, where insiders are restricted from selling shares for 6‚Äì12 months). This approach ensures a¬†**larger float**¬†right from the start, as insiders can sell their shares directly on the public market if they choose, increasing the number of shares available for trading.

Why is this important?

Palantir almost immediately qualified for index inclusion upon its first day of listing. Vanguard and others were forced to buy shares on the¬†**first week**¬†of listing because Palantir met the necessary requirements for most broad market indexes:

1. Market Cap - This is self explanatory, Palantir began listing at \~17B market cap, rendering it eligible for most indexes.
2. Free Float - Indexes are not just weighted by a company's market cap. The S&P500, for example, uses¬†**Float-Adjusted Market Cap**, adjusting the company‚Äôs market capitalization based on its free float to determine its weight in the index. Float-Adjusted¬†Market¬†Cap=Share¬†Price√óFree¬†Float¬†Shares
3. Liquidity - Also a no brainer, considering the number of shares immediately available for the public, and the hype around the stock.

It doesn't take a genius to see it. As insiders sell shares, the ‚Äúeffective float‚Äù rose, requiring extra purchases from index providers, and helping Palantir insiders exit.

[Vanguard = Liquidity ](https://preview.redd.it/630t26f5vy2e1.jpg?width=801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b54299e2988d9b42437fe9eb7d9db3f407cf904b)

**Part 2: Buying a Seat at the Table**

2021-2022 was tough for Palantir. The index game was faltering as net income and revenue growth lagged. This threatened their ultimate goal of S&P500 + Nasdaq 100 inclusion. They had the market cap, if they could only find a way to juice their revenue in a profitable way to get themselves over the inclusion requirements!

So, they did what any reasonable company in this situation would do, and bought customers. Financing customer growth by¬†[investing roughly $450MM in over two dozen SPACs](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-29/palantir-failed-to-spot-pattern-in-spac-debacle), Palantir was basically¬†[buying revenue.](https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue)

The process was straightforward:

1. PLTR would invest in the SPAC and assume a significant controlling interest
2. PLTR would use the SPAC's funds to purchase PLTR services
3. Any operating losses of the SPAC company could be carefully hidden from PLTR's reporting.

[Not part of operating income!](https://preview.redd.it/ydfikqj6vy2e1.jpg?width=1254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19a6a7d123b4cf926e5dd07b1ce374ac30061bb2)

And, soon enough, PLTR was (technically) reporting profitability by GAAP standards! With the company now profitable, in 2024 it became eligible for SP500 inclusion, and was included in September 2024, coinciding with a face-melting rally.

**Part 3: The Next Frontier**

To wind out its strategy, Palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion, capped off by its¬†**relisting to Nasdaq**¬†to position itself for entry into the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ).

The timing of the move is also suspect. The index‚Äôs modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents, disproportionately favoring mid-tier companies ranked between #10 and #30 in market cap‚Äîexactly where Palantir has maneuvered itself.

This move is no coincidence. Palantir‚Äôs ownership by the big three institutional investors‚ÄîVanguard, BlackRock, and State Street‚Äîhas soared to an impressive¬†**22.23%**, surpassing even tech giants like¬†**Microsoft (20.5%)**,¬†**Apple (20.0%)**, and¬†**NVIDIA (20.17%)**. For a company that only went public in Q4-2020, this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size.

And the insiders? They're loving the exit liquidity.

https://preview.redd.it/2ovaqp09vy2e1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c9e88a0d96b9b0e6402d50835979bd1d34530e2

In fact, they've been dumping into the institutions (and retail) this whole time:

https://preview.redd.it/2p4k1qx7vy2e1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b0be708d61438cdcf2e779d1216cd3e9696140a

""Show me the incentive, and I will tell you the outcome.""

Institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders. They're brainless, rules-based buyers. And, once the entire world owns an equal share of your company, priced at 50x sales, and you've dumped most of your shares, you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock!

Of course, index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals. The net \~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth in just the past few weeks.

Overall, I think there's huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes, knowing it's full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity. PLTR is just one of many, and they're giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak.

TL;DR: The recent PLTR tweet about joining the QQQ was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals.",2024-11-24 22:26:48

GME liquidy is drying up - causing the share to become more and more volatile,"[https://i.imgur.com/DxM4SwP.png](https://i.imgur.com/DxM4SwP.png)

I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from [this savant's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/).

As the free-flowing stock dries up (due to ppl buying and holding), the volatility increases. It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money. As long as you keep holding and buying, the volatility will only increase. **Expect huge swings in the next few days.**

Hedge funds know this. They tanked the stock this morning. Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable; to make it look like the ride is over.

HOWEVER

The short float is still high, and the [volume has been steadily decreasing](https://i.imgur.com/eRH3S2b.png).

Furthermore, [institutional ownership](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings) only picked up about 12m shares, and some of those went to institutions that were long not short. Now maybe I'm misreading this, or maybe they're fudging the data, but I just don't see how the shorts covered their position with this measly volume.

|Sold out positions|34|3,412,841|

Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short-interest than is currently in GME. The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.

Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile. Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price.

We need to talk about NOK,"&#x200B;

**Feb 4, mid-market:** Thank you everyone for your support. I really don't know what to say. The company keeps getting pounded because GME is having a sell-off, which doesn't make any sense. But that's the market for you. It doesn't always make sense.

I still believe 2021 will be a big year for Nokia, although it doesn't look like there is any way we'll manage the crazy play anymore. Still, it was nice to see something that was impossible become possible, even if it was for only a few days.

And remember, we can still do it any day. All it takes is for us to work together. If you want. Make up your own mind. 

I'm still holding. NOK will recover from this. Fair value is at least 4.81, and way more when 5G really gets going. So if you can, I would buy some more now. You'll thank me later for the tip. It may not be the most exciting play, but it is what investing is all about. Slow and steady growth that compounds to make a big change.

One of these days I'll be able to post again, when the mods lift the restrictions on new posts and things get a little less crazy around here. When I post again about NOK, I'll post the link here too. Thanks everyone!

**Feb 4 premarket:** Earnings out! They beat expectations a bit, their revenue was a little smaller than expected. Overall, good quarter, good year. Here it is: [https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia\_results\_2020\_q4.pdf](https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia_results_2020_q4.pdf)

**Feb 2, end of da**y: It's getting pretty crazy out there, but here's what you should know. The NOK chart is following the GME chart. It's got way more shares so the bumps and dips are more stable, but that's the main trend.

**What that means**: GME has no underlying value at this level. It is a gamble on the short squeeze. It might pay off, or it might not. If people panic sell like yesterday, it won't.

NOK is very different. It has underlying value. So if someone dumps it below its target price, the best thing to do is just to buy and wait for the value to go down. Thursday NOK reveals its earnings, and they are likely to be good based on what Ericsson revealed. Ericsson is one of its main competitors and a very similar company currently trading at twice the NOK price.

Feb 1, end of day: Told you it was a value share! Still trading at target, still low risk.

Either dumping has stopped, or normies are piling in because of the results. Either way good news, hope you made some money today!Vol today 190m, still way above average. Normal average 30m before we changed it lol. That means since Wednesday over 2bn shares have changed hands. Hope you got em!

Ericsson (NOK competitor) results suggest NOK will report good numbers this week, NOK upped to BUY on market watch: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01)

Unless my math is retarded (which it is cos ahmsodumb), if everyone (7m) on this sub spends $3000 at current price ($4.55) we BUY THE FLOAT. The more they keep dumping, the more shares we get cheap. Think about it.EDIT: buying the ENTIRE float is NOT the point of this play. I know share price goes up when supply is restricted, just read the play. This is just an example of what happens when they dump a value share on millions of retail investors.

Added new summary (30 Jan), and Q&A.

FIRST OFF: This post is not financial advice or anything except the rant of some idiot retard who is an idiot. I tell you straight up that there is a normal investment side to the NOK play (STILL MEANS RISK, which YOU will have to decide!) and that there is a CRAZY side that is PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE. If you want to play the crazy play then you‚Äôre also a crazy retard idiot just like me.

I don‚Äôt know shit, I just look at graphs and go WOW. Do your own due diligence, I am not a financial advisor. Don‚Äôt ask me if you should buy, I don‚Äôt know, can you afford to? Are you comfortable with the risks? I don‚Äôt know these things. You do.

**NOK PLAY:**

Here‚Äôs how it works. YOU DECIDE if you want to take part.

1.It‚Äôs **not a short squeeze like GME**. Get that out of your head.

2.It‚Äôs a **value/momentum** play. The value part is just normal granny&grampa investing. See a good company going cheap, buy and hold. Tell your mom, dad, granny and grampa, cousins, relatives, friends.

3.The **momentum part is the crazy part**, and if it works the share will SKYROCKET as long as YOU DON‚ÄôT SELL. GME is the biggest short squeeze in history, the NOK play could be the biggest value buy in history.

4. The beauty of it is that **it works because Wall St is dumping NOK irrationally**. That‚Äôs why the price is going down (slowly). They think they‚Äôre attacking us and slowly winning, but they‚Äôre giving us a value share cheap = their money, our pockets. By the time they realize what we did, it will be too late.

5. **Don‚Äôt panic, and keep buying the dumps (if you think the company has value)**, and if we hold the line **you could see a miracle.**

3310 HANDS

&#x200B;

**Value Part (crazy part in Q&A):**

The company is healthy, has good financials, it‚Äôs a market leader in 5G (it‚Äôs main competitors are Huawei and Ericsson, they have about the same market share share of 5G) a lot of potential to be the company that builds 5G for a large part of the world. NOK is currently trading at a standard price for the value it holds. It is not a bubble.

Here‚Äôs Nokia‚Äôs 5G contracts: [https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/)

Here‚Äôs Bloomberg shitting bricks that we‚Äôve realized that Nokia is a value bet: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t)

Nokia also just unveiled new 1tb tech, the thing AFTER 5G. First on the world. They have it, they‚Äôre showing the world it works. Here is their press release from Wednesday: [https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27)

They are so trusted that NASA got them to build a cell network on the MOON. Literally. If you‚Äôre NASA, would you hire your retard uncle Earl to build cell towers on the moon? No, you hire someone who CAN ACTUALLY DO IT. Imagine what it takes to build something really big and complicated on the moon? Now imagine who‚Äôs the likely guy who can do it. That‚Äôs right, NOKIA. Here they are, going to the moon: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

If the Huawei 5G war continues, who do you think US and Europe is going to back, especially since NOK already has the next tech, owns a bunch of patents, is from FINLAND that has never tried to take over the world and has a brand that EVERYONE who lived in 2000s remembers?

Here‚Äôs a guy who‚Äôs been doing the numbers for a while now in case you want to see them: [https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part\_iv\_option\_chain\_analysis\_on\_nok\_and\_why\_you/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part_iv_option_chain_analysis_on_nok_and_why_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I don‚Äôt know him, I don‚Äôt know the numbers as well, but looks pretty good to me. Amazing due diligence. But what do I know, I‚Äôm an idiot. So is he. So are you. We‚Äôre all fucking retards, just ask Wall Street. I poked myself in the same eye twice yesterday. We‚Äôre ‚Äúdumb money‚Äù. They have other names for us too.

So, worst case, you just bought into a good company at a fair value. If the crazy play doesn‚Äôt work, you just hold on to them and let them become the world leader in 5G. Unlike GME (NOT SAYING SELL!), NOK will not fall 99%. Or if it does, I'M BUYING THAT SHIT because if a HEALTHY COMPANY FALLS 99% you make some CRAZY MONEY on that when it bounces back.

**Q&A**

**Q: You retards were tricked by bots to buying NOK, there‚Äôs no short**

A: This just full on doesn‚Äôt get what the play is about. IT IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE. THIS IS NOT GME RINSE REPEAT. GME IS A DIFFERENT PLAY. NOK IS A VALUE PLAY. How many more ways can I say it? Not sure. How many more do I have to?

**Q: Stop taking attention away from GME you retards**

A: Nobody is saying sell your GME. Nobody is saying that. GME is too expensive for a lot of people, and GME is VERY RISKY and NOK has genuine value behind it. If the NOK play works, those people who couldn‚Äôt afford GME can still get on & get rich. If it doesn‚Äôt, they most likely still make money on a good company.

**Q: This play is impossible / crazy / it‚Äôll never work / there are too many shares you retards**

A: This is ALMOST true. This play WAS impossible until 1/27/2021. That is why nobody has EVER tried anything like this. But it‚Äôs NOT impossible anymore. Look at this graph. Look at it. See that spike? What the fuck is that? I‚Äôll tell you my fellow autistic space boot packin 3310 using NOKSTER.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v473xl00ghe61.png?width=2182&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf5aac455156dbadb919b80afacb5232af0a05b5

That spike was them running out of shares for half an hour. Trade was stopped until they could find more, to avoid an artificial spike in the price.

Proof? Look at the volumes. A small sale (red) causes a small dip. Two small buys cause a MASSIVE SPIKE. They ran out, and had to call their friends to liquidate more shares so the price wouldn‚Äôt skyrocket ""artificially"".

But that‚Äôs IMPOSSIBLE for NOK. NOK has 5bn shares. Nokia should be much more stable because it has so many shares, having a crazy demand spike is crazy. I saw it, and fell off my chair and since I‚Äôm such a retard it took me an hour to get back up.

So it **was** impossible, and that‚Äôs why Wall Street won‚Äôt see it coming. They think this is their attack and they‚Äôre about to break through our ranks, but they‚Äôre actually playing right into our hands.

Wendnesday, we moved 1bn shares. Thursday, when nobody could buy, we still moved 500m. Yesterday, we still moved 360m. We‚Äôve moved so much NOK in the past three days, the average volume of the share has MORE THAN DOUBLED in THREE DAYS. The play is not impossible anymore, but Wall St thinks it is, which is how we can use their own strength and mass against them. But the value buy still makes sense WHENEVER you see someone dump a valuable share. Someone sells you a 100$ bill for 90$? Buy it.

They attack? We absorb. They dump, we buy, they run out of shares, we hold. They‚Äôre fucked, and they just handed us a bunch of value shares at an undervalue = they just gave us their money. They are just giving it to you. When they realize they can‚Äôt buy them back at a lower value, what do you think is going to happen?

**Q: We don‚Äôt do value plays, we do short squeezes you retards**

A: Go back to April. Look at u/DeepFuckingValue‚Äôs position. **GME was a value play**. It‚Äôs only in April that the Short Squeeze became possible. Look it up yourself.

Will a short squeeze also happen with NOK? It‚Äôs unlikely. Hedge Fund Assholes have been increasing their shorts in NOK in the last few days, but they won‚Äôt go over 100% on 5bn shares because they're not as stupid as me. But it doesn‚Äôt have to happen. We just need to buy the dumps. If they short, great. More money for us as long as we don‚Äôt let them drive the price down with the dumps.

**Q: Why is NOK not rocketing?**

A: Because Wall Street is dumping, just like I said they would after the Wednesday spike. That‚Äôs the whole plan. They dump, we hold the line, buy the dumps and keep the price steady.

The GME short squeeze guys waited for this for UP TO TWO YEARS. I saw it in April. I thought it was crazy. I didn‚Äôt jump in back then. If I did, I‚Äôd have about as much money as u/DeepFuckingValue. On a value share, you can afford to wait. GME was originally a value play. That‚Äôs what I should have realized in April.

SO JUST WAIT AND HOLD (if you believe and idiot like me, which you shouldn't, no need to message me about it). It‚Äôs been two days since this play even became possible.

**Q: How do we know it‚Äôs working?**

A: Look at the volume of shares traded. Nokia has 5bn shares. In the last three days, nearly 2bn have been traded. The price is still up from last week. That‚Äôs how.

This has already been a giant dumping campaign. How come the price hasn‚Äôt floored? What happens if we just buy it all up?

What happens if they run out, and then their shorts blow, the price bumps up, CNBC tells the world we broke another short wall, everyone piles on, Wall Street realizes they just gave us their shares at an undervalue and try to buy back, we don‚Äôt sell, we have all the shares? The Wednesday spike is what happens, except this time there is no stopping it. If they stop trading again and try to dump some more, you just buy up the dump and keep the spike going. Spike stops being a spike and becomes a floor.

&#x200B;

**Q: Where will this max out and when?**

A: What do you think I‚Äôm from the future? I just saw an impossible thing happen on Wednesday, and we need to make it happen again. Look at the graph. Look at it.

Set your targets to $3310, that should do it.

**Q: When should I buy? What should I buy? Should I buy?**

A: Be your own person. Buy when you feel like it, if you feel like it.

**Q: Wall street bots are promoting NOK.**

A: I don‚Äôt give a shit. If they are, and we keep buying, they are promoting giving us money.

&#x200B;

Part 2: (29 Jan)

First off, much as I appreciate the love, I can‚Äôt play your hand for you. You have to make your own decisions. Do I know where NOK is going to be tomorrow? Nope. Nobody does. All that I have for you is the news from Wednesday that this play is no longer totally impossible:

1. I think the assholes are going to try to dump you out of the market
2. It won‚Äôt work if we keep the demand up.
3. The way we keep demand up is we buy, and others will follow us because the company is good.
4. When they realize it won‚Äôt work, they‚Äôll need to start buying back in.
5. Then it‚Äôll be too late, cos they dumped their shares on US and we are RETARDS who HOLD. That means that when their shorts start to go bust, the price will jump up (a little bit, not like with GME at first ‚Äì this is a different play based on the health of the company, not a straight up short squeeze. The short position on NOK is much smaller).
6. When the price jumps up, and the GME guys start cashing out, they need somewhere to put that cash. Some of them pay off student loans, or buy cars or whatever, but the smart ones will go NOK.

How you play it is up to you. I can‚Äôt tell you if you should buy, what minute to buy, what app to use and so on. All I can say is I buy the dumps. You need to decide for yourself if you want to do it. You can see the dumps on any app, or even yahoo finance. I buy NOK on NYSE, and I buy straight up shares (so they can‚Äôt lend out mine for shorts) but you‚Äôre free to do what you want. I‚Äôm a retard, you‚Äôre a retard, we‚Äôre all autistic fucks, we make up our own mind and stick with it.

Secondly, what I said yesterday morning would happen, did happen. And it happened exactly like I said it would. So don‚Äôt get scared off, just buy the dumps. And they know that they‚Äôll be fucked if we keep buying the dumps. That‚Äôs why they stopped us from buying NOK.

NOK hasn‚Äôt bubbled, stopping us from buying NOK was because they know we‚Äôre on to them. They know the dumps won‚Äôt work if we JUST KEEP BUYING and HOLDING. The play works, they‚Äôre scared, we caught them with their pants down, they‚Äôre trying to get ahead of us.

OK, so about what happened yesterday with RH and others. I‚Äôm so fucking angry about this.

What RH and others did is completely insane. Their argument is ‚Äúyou guys are throwing your money away on a bubble, we‚Äôre just protecting you‚Äù. Bullshit. I won‚Äôt comment on GME, I‚Äôll let u/DeepFuckingValue or one of those guys do that. I‚Äôll just say, that short squeezes happen with hedge funds all the fucking time. Why is trading not stopped for them? They have people‚Äôs fucking pensions that they‚Äôre playing with.

But for NOK, it‚Äôs TOTAL BULLSHIT. Here‚Äôs why:

1. NOK HAS NOT BUBBLED. Look at the graph. Look at it. It is still down from 2016. NOK is well within normal variation. Long term, you barely see the spike from a couple of days ago. There is nothing to ‚Äúprotect us‚Äù from. They‚Äôre protecting themselves.
2. The NOK play is not a straight up short squeeze. The play is HELPED by the shorts that are there, as long as we can keep the demand up and keep the price up against the dumping, but that‚Äôs all.
3. NOK is a healthy company, with new and important tech, a great brand, a lot of potential. You want to see why, read the original post. ANYONE who sees a company like that being dumped for NO REASON would buy. So should you. They are only dumping it because they‚Äôre trying to fuck up our play.

Ok that‚Äôs enough for now. I‚Äôll see you all when I‚Äôve got my space boots on, in my house on the FUCKING MOON, next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I‚Äôll see you in VALHALLA with my broke ass. If this doesn‚Äôt work, then at least you TOOK ON THE MOTHERFUCKERS and EARNED A PLACE at the table with FUCKING ODIN.

UNBREAKABLE 3310!

**ORIGINAL POST (28 Jan):**

I get it, it‚Äôs not the play. I‚Äôm not saying sell your GME. I‚Äôm not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I‚Äôm a regular guy who‚Äôs got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don‚Äôt agree with me, just say so.

I‚Äôm also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks.

But, BUT, yesterday we did something they‚Äôve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That‚Äôs what that big spike was, and that‚Äôs why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it‚Äôs too late.

Impossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That‚Äôs never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world.

3516.16% of average trading volume.

Do you get it? They‚Äôll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won‚Äôt be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Why do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don‚Äôt want ‚Äúartificial‚Äù spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That‚Äôs why that spike went down right after the freeze.

But then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn‚Äôt go down. The assholes who‚Äôd just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who‚Äôd convinced them.

Everyone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.

What did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we‚Äôre retards (they are correct).

But how come the price didn‚Äôt go down? It‚Äôs got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?

Because the retard brigade was buying it. There‚Äôs 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that‚Äôs 300m shares.

Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets.

And normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bubble that‚Äôs going to crash on them.

So why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I‚Äôm not saying sell GME).

Because GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who‚Äôs just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.

Not so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let‚Äôs not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.

You know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why?

What else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I‚Äôm not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that‚Äôs going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade ‚Äì Do you think we‚Äôre going to need more data this year than last year?

Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn‚Äôt handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?

But why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?

US and Europe can‚Äôt buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren‚Äôt afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn‚Äôt really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.

Want proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

And we‚Äôre going to send them there. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

But hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it‚Äôs so great?

Answer: because Microsoft fucked them. That‚Äôs right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who‚Äôd be fucked if someone did that to Apple now.

Worked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered.

The asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up.

So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don‚Äôt they have? Money. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works.

But if we drive the share price up, do you think that‚Äôs going to change?

So FUCK IT. I‚Äôm in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I‚Äôll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I‚Äôll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.

TL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon. Go there with them. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

TLDR: The graph above represents SAVA's data (red line), and other lines represent competition and placebo. SAVA's cognitive data is not only far superior to the competition; it is the only drug that shows cognitive improvement on ADAS-cog in a US-based trial.

Below is what I was able to fit into reddit minus images.

&#x200B;

**1) Cassava Sciences - The Future of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Medicine**

Cassava Sciences (NASDAQ: SAVA) has publicly released the most promising data on Alzheimer‚Äôs treatment to date. Their revolutionary oral drug, Simufilam, as well as their rapid AD diagnostic blood test SavaDX, will potentially solve the largest unmet medical need in medicine. No other Alzheimer‚Äôs (AD) drug has been shown to be more effective in human trials (Phase 2b in 2021).In a breakthrough achievement, Cassava‚Äôs Simufilam hit the trifecta for medical treatment of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease ‚îÄ groundbreaking effectiveness, excellent safety, and, equally important, improved patient behavior.

Cassava‚Äôs CEO, Remi Barbier, expressed extreme confidence by stating, ‚ÄúWe are 100% planning on success‚Äù.Eventually, Cassava Sciences will have a binary outcome. However, the existing clinical data reveals a high probability (>90%) of success which we will discuss in-depth below. Recent interest by the FDA in the AD space has led to sharp increases in the market caps of BIIB, LLY, and RHBBY (details discussed below). Simufilam can expect the same upon FDA Approval. This presents investors with a valuable asymmetric risk-benefit investment opportunity. What are asymmetrical investments?

&#x200B;

Over ten years scientists Dr. Hoau-Yan Wang from The City College of New York (CUNY) and Cassava‚Äôs Dr. Lindsay Burns developed Simufilam. The journey began when research on postmortem brain dissections revealed the prominent role of tau deposits in Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. They discovered Filamin A (FLNA) , when altered, plays a central role in [tau hyperphosphorylation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28438486/) and neuroinflammation. Based on this process, in 2011, Dr. Wang and Dr. Burns identified a binding molecule, Simufilam (PTI-125). Ten years later, SAVA‚Äôs Simufilam is in a position to revolutionize AD medicine.

Essentially, by reducing tau hyperphosphorylation and inflammation, Simufilam can stop and even reverse the progression of AD to improve the function of the patient.

üì∑

**2) The Vision: Altering Alzheimer‚Äôs Progression and Improving the Lives of Millions of AD Patients and Their Families**

Doctors often face the sad scenario where families bring their elderly relatives to the ER as they are unable to take care of them‚Äînot because they have become forgetful, but their agitation and aggressiveness have become unmanageable.Unfortunately, these families have already navigated a complex medical system and know AD is terminal with no efficacious treatment. While heart disease, strokes, sepsis, and other diseases have a myriad of remedies, tragically AD does not. According to the CDC, [AD ranks as the sixth leading cause of death](https://www.cdc.gov/dotw/alzheimers/index.html), and by other estimates, AD is the third leading cause of death for our elderly.

The unacceptable mortality statistics do little justice to the true scope of AD-related morbidity. Beyond death, AD has a tremendous impact on families, physicians, and society which can be assessed by its economic impact. The Overall Costs for AD are astronomical. Alzheimer's disease is projected to cost US $1.1 trillion dollars by [2050](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures).

üì∑

The progression towards death in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is heartbreaking. Out of every 1,000 Medicare hospital admissions, 538 are associated with AD. Not only are there far more hospitalizations associated with AD, but those hospitalizations are also more complex, have increased duration, and more frequently result in death when compared to non-AD patients.

Decades of failure in the AD space have led to skeptics who believe AD cannot be cured or even effectively treated. However, other neurological diseases faced similar challenges in the past. In Parkinson‚Äôs, the medication Sinemet had an extraordinary impact with patients realizing dramatic and immediate improvement. The improvement facilitates decades of time to live independent lives. No such therapy exists for AD, though Simufilam has firm potential to break this paradigm.

The Amyloid hypothesis has dominated AD research which has led to over 100 failed attempts, most following the amyloid hypothesis, targeting a symptom rather than a root cause of the disease. The process for researchers to examine ADs from different [perspectives](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alzheimers-inc-when-a-hypothesis-becomes-too-big-to-fail/) has been slow and challenging but has begun. Simufilam has led the way. Simulfilam‚Äôs breakthrough method of targeting the root cause is a novel approach that sidesteps duplicating the missteps of the past. It is a disease-modifying therapy meant to treat Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. Current therapies provide only symptomatic improvement.  Simufilam has the potential to slow cognitive decline, improving the quality of life and even perhaps extending the duration of life for millions of AD patients.

Simufilam additionally improves activities of daily living (ADLs) for many AD patients by reducing Behavioral Disturbances. This makes it much easier for caregivers and for families to care for their loved ones.  Family members experience extreme guilt when they can no longer care for their loved one often progressing to something known as Caregiver Stress Syndrome, characterized by extreme mental, physical & emotional exhaustion and strongly associated with negative health outcomes including depression and anxiety. Further downstream, Simufilam will decrease the burden on our healthcare system and its economic impact.

In summary, AD is a disease process that starts with one patient, affects a whole family,  and will snowball into a trillion-dollar problem for society, if unaddressed.  Simufilam‚Äôs never before seen trifecta of improved cognition, improved ADLs, and less behavioral disturbance is the overdue solution.

**3) Massive Market Opportunity: The Future $Trillion AD Ecosystem**

Apple, Netflix, Tesla, and numerous other companies revolutionized their Industries with innovative technologies, creating trillions of dollars in value. Upon approval of Simufilam, Cassava will have the most successful drug in history and will enter their Prestigious ranks. [Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), a senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, stated, ""If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history.‚Äù

The market has yet to accurately price SAVA‚Äôs intrinsic value. Currently, it is pricing in 1-2% chance of success. In the following analysis, we will definitively show that the possibility of success (POS) is greater than 90%.  This presents an extraordinary opportunity for institutional and retail investors.

Humira‚Äôs total addressable market grosses approximately $20 billion annually while being used by 1.1 million patients worldwide (65% in the US). Meanwhile, the US Alzheimer‚Äôs market is at least 5 times larger.  It is also pertinent to mention Humira has several direct competitors (Simufilam has no competition). We estimate the AD market to expand as treatment becomes available. Most physicians hesitate to diagnose AD when treatment does not exist. In such cases, a diagnosis is a prolonged death sentence. Thus when a treatment is available, the incidence of diagnosed AD will likely increase.

Specifically, there are 6 million AD patients in the US and 15 million mild cognitive impairment (pre-AD) patients. Globally there are 55 million AD patients. This represents potential revenues that can surpass $100 billion annually.

While the market has been slow to comprehend this opportunity, it is not oblivious to it. On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication. The market cap increased by ***$17 billion*** in one day\*\*.\*\* Similarly the day $LLY and $RHBBY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) of their AD medication, their market cap increased by ***$15 billion and*** **$13 billion,** respectively (on the same day). All three of these medications demonstrated little to no cognitive benefit and have unsafe risk profiles resulting in brain swelling and bleeding.

In addition to Simufilam, Cassava Sciences has released data on SavaDx. Its importance can not be overstated. AD is a disease that starts decades before clinical symptoms present. Said more simply, AD damages the brain before patients develop memory loss. From a patient's perspective, by the time memory loss develops, it's already too late. This is why clinical neurologists believe preventing AD is more important than treating it. SavaDx gives us the opportunity to prevent AD. It is a simple blood test that can accurately screen AD decades before neuronal injury and death. Early diagnosis with SavaDx gives clinicians the ability to treat AD before it causes irreversible damage in the brain. We envision this patient cohort to become the largest treatable population, upwards of fifteen million, based on the rate of expansion of the AD population.

Once Simufilam enters the market, Cassava‚Äôs SavaDx will rapidly expand Alzheimer‚Äôs diagnosis and treatment. SavaDX is currently being evaluated alongside Simufilam in SAVA‚Äôs Phase 3 trials.  It is clear that the FDA understands the importance of early diagnosis. Quanterix was granted BTD by the FDA for its version of SavaDx in 2021.

Market penetration is generally slower for new medications as associated adverse events are often not fully understood by physicians. More importantly, older alternative treatments often exist. With Simufilam‚Äôs excellent safety profile and a market with no adequate or alternate treatment, we foresee Simufilam‚Äôs uptake to be relatively rapid.

Lastly, below we examine the plethora of medical literature supporting added indications for Simufilam. Filamin-A (FLNA), Simufilam‚Äôs target, has been implicated in multiple diseases. Yale is aggressively pursuing and has shown clinical benefit in hard-to-treat seizures. A review of medical literature has implicated FLNA in cardiovascular disease. In fact, FLNA is present throughout the body and plays a role in many disease processes including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, strokes to name a few possibilities. The authors of this analysis believe Simufilam will balloon into a new class of medications similar to monoclonal antibodies.

üì∑

**4) The Science**

üì∑

SImufilam has two primary mechanisms. 1) Decreasing neuroinflammation 2) Decreasing Tau Hyperphosphorylation.

FLNA is a complex scaffolding protein with many associated functions and associations. Work by Dr. Wang and Dr. Burns revealed when FLNA‚Äôs formation is altered it caused increased binding between AB42 and a cellular membrane protein complex setting off a cascade causing neuroinflammation (via TLR4 receptor), and Neurodegeneration (via the A7 receptor). Simufilam interacts with FLNA to decrease AB42 and the protein complex binding. This in turn stops Inflammation and neurodegeneration (secondary to decrease Tau hyperphosphorylation).  Both the degree of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration can be gauged with biomarkers associated with the above cascades. These biomarkers include:

1. Abeta42
2. Total Tau
3. P-tau181
4. Neurogranin
5. Neurofilament Light Chain
6. YKL-40
7. Paired Associates Learning Test
8. Spatial Working Memory Test
9. IL-6
10. sTREM2
11. HMGB1
12. Albumin
13. IgG
14. Filamin A Linkages to alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor
15. Toll-like Receptor 4 in Subject Lymphocytes
16. Plasma P-tau181
17. SavaDx

In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, all 17 biomarkers improved in patients taking Simufilam. We will discuss these spectacular results in more detail below.

To measure both improvement and decline in AD Patients under an experimental drug, we must perform tests on memory/IQ (cognition), activities of daily living (ADLs, ie. patient independence), psychiatric problems (behavioral issues), and stress imposed on caregivers. It helps to have ‚Äúhard‚Äù measures such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid tests, as well as MRIs measuring brain shrinkage.

**Phase 2 Cognition Data Shows Incredible Improvement in AD Patients‚Ä¶**

Per [Woodland Report](https://woodlandreport.com/2021/11/cassava-sciences-sava-alzheimers-drug-may-be-the-best-drug-in-history/):

‚Äú[ADAS-Cog](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1533317509350298) is the cognitive test used for SAVA‚Äôs trial. It is considered the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù test for evaluating AD drugs and how all AD drugs are ultimately evaluated by the FDA. To date, Simufilam is the only drug that has shown improvement in ADAS-cog, in a US-based trial.

The ADAS-cog is essentially an IQ/memory test, not an opinion survey. Compared to other cognitive tests such as MMSE, the ADAS-Cog is more sensitive and more comprehensive, requiring 45 minutes to complete. Below we discuss why this test is so thorough making it an accurate measure in AD.

[ADAS-Cog has 11 parts](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad170991) (Dimensions):

* &#x200B;

1. Word Recall Task

* 2. Naming Objects and Fingers
* 3. Following Commands
* 4. Constructional Praxis
* 5. Ideational Praxis
* 6. Orientation
* 7. Word Recognition Task
* 8. Remembering Test Directions
* 9. Spoken Language
* 10. Comprehension
* 11. Word-Finding Difficulty

Based on 70 points, a higher score implies more errors (worse cognition). Eight of the 11 parts are objective. The other 3 require some subjective judgment to score, though there are clear guidelines in how they are scored. Let‚Äôs get into some detail.

Dimensions 1-4, 6-7, and 11 (i.e., seven out of eleven of all dimensions in ADAS-Cog) offer little room for random error, subjectivity, or rater bias as this assessment has a clear right or wrong answer.

üì∑

For example, consider dimension #1, Word Recall. For this, ""A list of 10 words is read by the subject, and then the subject is asked to verbally recall as many of the words as possible. This test is repeated three times. The number of words not recalled across the three trials is averaged giving a score of 0 to 10. The test administrator does not use his subjective judgment at all; instead, the patient either remembers each of the 10 words or not.

üì∑

Another example, consider dimension #6, which assesses orientation. The subject is asked the date, month, year, day of the week, season, time of day, place, and person. The number of correct responses ranges from 0 to 8. The patient either correctly knows where he or she is or does not know; no subjective judgment is needed.

Take a look at the other dimensions that have clear right-or-wrong answers (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 7, and 11).

üì∑Across the seven dimensions, the total number of available errors a patient can show is 49 (about 70% of all errors available).

Dimensions #5 and #8-10 (which together constitute 30% of all errors available)? These may not have clear right-or-wrong answers, however, ADAS-Cog test administrators receive training to avoid differences in scoring due to subjectivity. For dimension #5, Ideational Praxis, ""The subject is asked to send a letter to themselves.  The instructions are:

1. Fold the letter
2. Put the letter in an envelope
3. Seal the envelope
4. Address the envelope
5. Put a stamp on the envelope

Scored from 0 to 5 based on the difficulty of performing the five components. If the patient adequately finishes all letter-sending tasks mentioned, then they'd get a 0 (no error). Difficulty in performing the steps warrants an assignment of an error point. As the reader can see, this is straightforward to score.

For dimensions #8-10, the administrator has a 10-minute open-ended conversation with the patient, and at the end, the test giver rates the patient from 0-5 per quality of the patient's speech based on:

1. How well the patient understands what the administrator is saying
2. The difficulty the patient has in finding desired words

If the patient speaks like a typical person like you and me, they'd get a 0 for each of the three dimensions (#8-10). To a clinician, these distinctions are obvious and take little thought. All physicians, PAs, and Nurse Practitioners learn to assess orientation and conversational skills early in training. These are some of the earliest clues to cognitive impairment and are a required assessment on basic history and physical exam (H&P).

Further, In psychometrics, researchers often deal with such performance or ability-based questions that do not readily offer clear right or wrong response options--and instead rely on the judgment of the rater. To mitigate this familiar issue, for decades researchers have developed rater training techniques to form a consensus on what type or degree of behavior corresponds to roughly what score. Rather than each rater using their own unique/idiosyncratic standards. An additional mitigation tactic is another party observing the test and giving their own score independently which is done at the AD trial sites. In addition, many clinical sites that perform cognitive testing for Cassava Sciences are also responsible to perform cognitive testing for LLY and BIIB via ADAS. To highlight this point, recent ADAS-cog testing showed little improvement in both LLY‚Äôs and BIIB‚Äôs medication over thousands of patients assessed. These same assessors gave Cassava Sciences‚Äô patients scores clearly indicating improved cognition.

As these clinical test sites specialize in research trials in AD drugs (also performing studies for SAVA‚Äôs competitors, it‚Äôs what they professionally do), they would have a close familiarity with the ADAS-Cog. By definition, these physicians‚Äô test-judging styles would form the gold standard. Notably, SAVA does not have involvement with how the sites are run; SAVA requests that the sites use ADAS-Cog per cognitive measurement and then the sites take it from there.

In (Ihl et al., 2012) the authors describe ""the collection of ADAS-Cog-11 \[dimensions\] with the most potential for detecting a treatment response."" These dimensions were:

1. Ideational Praxis
2. Remembering Test Instructions
3. Language
4. Comprehension of Spoken Language
5. Word Finding Difficulty

Dimensions #5 and 8-10 (which constitute 30% of total errors) are all included in this subset. Based on actual empirical evidence, dimensions #5 and 8-10 are \*in practice\* largely objective and valid. Concerns of subjectivity are hypothetical, which has not been observed over decades of ADAS-cog administration.

As it turns out, the more subjective portions of the ADAS-Cog [have very little relative contribution](https://www.page-meeting.org/pdf_assets/2921-ADAScog_IRT_Sebastian_Ueckert.pdf) amongst patients.

üì∑

Instead, it is tests 1, 6, and 7 that have the greatest impact. These are right-or-wrong Word Recall and Orientation questions, which all test short term memory. This makes sense given AD is a disease of short term memory. Placebo effect is unlikely to make a person suddenly remember the day or location, or recall a list of words.

Of note, Phase 3 will use ADAS-Cog12 which adds a Delayed Recall section. This makes it more sensitive for mild cognitive impairment. Simufilam will target this larger group of people (15 million patients in the US).

Skeptics can argue that due to the open-label nature of the Phase 2b trial, physicians can still score certain sections favorably for SAVA. However, the math definitely suggests this is extremely unlikely to make up for the large 8.2-9.2 point difference between the 12-month data and placebo. In addition, open-label trials of other AD drugs using the ADAS-Cog do not show these same results (discussed in the section below). Unlike with Simufilam, those patients all declined from 6 months onward in both open-label and placebo-controlled trials. We will discuss a cohort of over 40,000 patients to make this clear, below. Essentially, AD is like Rabies or cancer.  Either it is treated, or it overwhelmingly leads to death. Thus if we see AD patients improving over 12 months, it is assuredly treatment effect, not placebo.‚Äù

**5) Why the data is so unique in both Biomarkers and Cognitive Data.**

## Biomarker Data Predicts Efficacy Simufilam

üì∑

Simufilam‚Äôs biomarker results were groundbreaking. Previous AD medication directly targeted a single focus downstream and corresponding biomarkers showed limited benefit.   Several surrogate markers like increased inflammation and cerebral atrophy (brain shrinking) that were reported by Simufilam‚Äôs competitors foreshadow negative clinical outcomes long term.  Comparatively, Simufilam works upstream and the effect can be analyzed by 17 biomarkers monitoring neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The totality of all 17 biomarkers makes for a much more convincing case than the few reported by competitors. To be clear, all 17 biomarkers checked by Cassava Sciences improved in a 28-day randomized controlled trial. The two most important biomarkers include AŒ≤42/40 ratio and ptau181 which directly correlate with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease progression.

The utility of biomarkers in AD is to predict cognitive improvement before it happens as cognitive improvement can take many months. After reviewing the spectacular biomarker data in the 28-day trial, we anticipated cognitive data improvement would follow. The Biomarkers predicted correctly, as expected:

## üì∑

The above ADAS-cog scores are what make Cassava Sciences a generational opportunity. Along with the biomarker data, these ADAS-cog score improvements have never been achieved in any US-based trial over 12 months. The Chart below shows Simufilam‚Äôs data (Red Line) compared to what is expected due to the natural course of the disease. This is represented by the Placebo group (Grey Line) and  Eli Lilly‚Äôs Donanemab (Green Line) trial. Simufilam Cohort results are vastly superior to both the Placebo and Donanemab Cohorts. Though BIIBs and RHHBYs medication has not been included on the below graph, the difference between Simufilam and those medications is just as significant.

The first 50 patients in the Phase 2b trials take place at 7 clinical sites (currently expanded to 200 patients and 16 sites). The table below shows patient selection. These are mild and moderate AD patients with an average age of approximately 70.

üì∑

üì∑

Biomarkers were followed on 25 of the 50 initial patients and continued to impress:

üì∑

Again, the biomarker data foreshadowed continued cognitive improvement correctly.  The mechanism of action (MOA) of Biogen‚Äôs Aduhelm (and many other Alzheimer‚Äôs drugs) seeks to directly target amyloid-beta to reduce the number of plaques, while Simufilam‚Äôs MOA  is further upstream and more comprehensive. It works by decreasing tau hyperphosphorylation and plaque build-up and decreasing inflammation.  By targeting a deeper, more fundamental cause, Simufilam serves as a more powerful means to not just clear the plaques, but also prevent formation. Biogen‚Äôs Aduhelm decreased pTau-181 levels by 13-16% at 12 months, Simufilam decreased it by 18% in half the time.

Is NASDAQ crashing because Generative AI turned out to be a big fart?,"Multiple sources (research papers, articles, etc) seem to indicate that Generative AI isn't really useful in the Enterprise space yet. 

Companies use it mostly to offer a bad Customer Support experience to their users, like they did with those awful chatbots a few years ago.

So, Nvidia sold a lot of chips, OpenAI and Microsoft sold a lot of subscriptions, and that's pretty much it.   
  
There aren't many other companies actually making money from AI, since there aren't real use cases where it's actually useful in a B2B case. 

OpenAI did a great job of promoting Gen AI as being the magical solution, we've all seen the article claiming that AI paid a human on Taskrabbit to solve a reCAPTCHA, but that never actually happened.

And Sam Altman tried so hard to make everyone believe that AI is so powerful and that he's worried it will take over the world, insisting that it should be regulated or we'll all die.

Hello again my fellow apesü¶ç!

BOILERPLATE: I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory üöÄ

WARNING: BY THE END OF THIS POST YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS EUPHORIA OR PREMATURE üöÄ SYNDROME. THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF 'CONFIRMATION BIAS'. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE.

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today‚Äôs data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading üòâ

\------------

**Part 1: FINRA**

I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http://regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https://www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))

(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)

There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.

The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.

**CAVEATS:**

* This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t
* **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.

Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.

**Assumptions used:**

GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)

GME Total Shares: 69,750,000

https://preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74

The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!

\----------

**Part 2: Borrowing Shares**

Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.

The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker‚Äôs FTP site ([https://iborrowdesk.com/about](https://iborrowdesk.com/about) ).

Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.

https://preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9

Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.

\----------

**Part 3: ETFs**

This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.

[https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.

https://preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274

[https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)

They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).

>‚Äú‚Ä¶we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).‚Äù

If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).

NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF

\----------

**TLDR:**

THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **üíéüôå** üíé will prevail!!!

**Stake:** shares in GME **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ**

For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:

""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""

Modified Discounted Cash Flow for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI),"Since my[ last post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hgflri/i_let_chatgpt_author_a_financial_model_human/)about TSLA predicted a market correction for the stock (as we are currently seeing as of March 2025), I am back with a different speculation idea for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI). **I have basically modified the framework of discounted cash flow (DCF) to function in terms of industry multiples.**

Instead of discounting each period's cash flow and adding them up, I decided to discount the net income in each period (using SoFi's cost of equity estimate) instead and then multiply that by the mean P/E ratio estimate for the finance industry, essentially deriving the stock price in today's value for each period of earnings. Finally, I averaged the results to find the price target for SoFi.

**Is this a methodologically correct method of financial modeling? No**, but I believe that this is a way to keep in mind the time value of money when evaluating P/E ratio ahead of today's earnings period.

**My conclusion is that SoFi is underpriced and has a decent upside ahead.** Please be mindful that the model's assumptions are not grounded on a scientific basis. Therefore, changes in assumptions could result in a drastically different conclusion.

Lastly, I understand that the extension of forecasted periods would ultimately result in the target price in future periods converging to zero as the discount factor increases exponentially, so the result I have is also highly dependent on how many forecast periods to include. For good measure, I decided to extend for 5 more years after the member growth is expected to stabilize at 3%.

GME may have the potential to dictate the course of the entire market. I did some research & analysis.,"Before I start, I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD, and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized. Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!

**Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.

New York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings

Nasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)

**TLDR;/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didn‚Äôt suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies/positions.

**In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.

**TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\*\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\*\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)

**START**

I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, I‚Äôve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.

&#x200B;

[GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https://preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)

If you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are ‚Äúcoincidences‚Äù as many have suggested.

**PROCESS**

I calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.

&#x200B;

[Covariance & Correlation Matrices.](https://preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)

[P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https://preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)

The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on ‚Äúluck‚Äù or ‚Äúchance‚Äù. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to ‚Äúluck‚Äù. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.

**So, what does this mean?**

**My opinions.**

To me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.

My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.

**Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**

Anyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.

I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR

**Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much

I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of ""correlation does not imply causation"". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **""strength""** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term ""significant"" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little ""\*"" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims "" helps turn food into cellular energy\*"" while other vitamins make claims with no ""\*"".

In layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.

Also, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.

So with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.

Lastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https://firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.

Other than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!

**Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.

[u\/big\_boolean Graph](https://preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)

As I read several times there could be the posibibility of maybe hitting a shareprice of several million dollars for either $GME, $AMC or whatever retards are trading with.

Technically there is a maximum amount that can be handled by the Nasdaq since may 17 wich is at 1,844,674,407,370,955.1615 USD

So here we have the maximum price for a hammer super Dupa short squeeze.

For the regards who don't know what the hell just happened,"For those regards who don't know why markets took a massive dump let me boil it down for you:

\- Markets had built in expectation of 4 rate cuts by end of 2024.

\- Papa Pow comes and shows in projections that FOMC participants expect only 2 rate cuts, if that.

\- Papa pow also suggested possibility one more rate hike Nov or Dec meeting.

\- Higher rates for longer = Lower current value of future cashflows of companies.

\- Tech is most sensitive to higher rates so Nasdaq got hit the worst.

\- Long story short - Bulls are fucked, Bears are fucked, T-bill and chill is the way to go. Having said that, let me grab some 1DTE puts on the SPX, because we are going down bois.

"This is why GAMESTOP won't STOP, and why $100k is NOT A MEME. (REPOSTED)","REPOST because I accidently included a relevant YouTube link in an edit (about a DRYS short squeeze) and this caused the automoderator to delete it). Sorry!

Also, since I got feedback I didn't include enough Emojis, here's a rectification:

# üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄü¶çü¶çü¶çüåôüíéüëê

First, let's look at the players involved here.

# The shorts

On the short side, we have some hedge funds (most notably Melvin and Citadel) who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain.

# The Market Makers (may have some overlap with the shorts)

Marker makers write options (contracts to be allowed to buy (call) or sell (put) shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date). They collect a fee for selling those contracts, but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless, because then they get to keep their fee, and don't need to keep their contract because it wasn't in the money. How does this work? Well, for example when GME was trading around $40, they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so, never expecting the price of GME to even reach anywhere near $800, so the ""fools"" who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls, or so they thought. (More on this later).

# The longs

On the long side, we have you glorious apes  ü¶ç ü¶ç ü¶ç, Cohen, and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on Melvin and other shorts, especially if they can make some money while doing so.

Now let's look at the actions that have led up to this.

It all started when the shorts were getting greedy, and with Covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster. They did not expect gamestop would survive covid, and they did everything in their power to make it so. Shorting the company to the ground, with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and tax-free profit. It's important to point out that they COULD have covered at $3\~$4 but DID NOT. If they did not cover at $3 or $4, what makes you think they covered at $40\~$400? Hint: they didn't. In fact, they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400+ was just a gamma squeeze. In other words they have not even begun to cover yet.

[Then some people liked the stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1p4up/a_refresher_on_what_the_is_going_on_with_gme/)

[Some people have calculated that the real short interest in somewhere between 250% and 967%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/). (something like 200 million to 500 million shares short). Some people may think this is insane, but if you do the math, you will see that no matter what FINRA says, it's impossible for short interest to be below 200%, and it's more likely to be around 500\~600%. It's hard to find reliable data, but if you just look at the volume and price action, it's obvious that the shorts have only INCREASED since January 28th, not decreased. It is mathematically IMPOSSABLE for the shorts to have covered. It simply doesn't add up.

# How the Gamma squeeze will trigger the short squeeze

Some people doubt this could reach $10k or even $100k, just as people doubted it could reach $1000s. But here is why those numbers are not only likely, but MATHEMATICALLY INEVITABLE. (I'm not an expert to so take it FWIW, feel free to call me an idiot, but if I'm right, I'll expect apologies).

First, let's look at the option interest (source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain))

Now, it's important to mention that the MMs will try to stay delta-neutral. In other words, they will start buying BEFORE the price hits strike price. When the MMs sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40, they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that GME would hit $800 by march 12th. However, now, that chance is approaching 1% and climbing. The MMs still don't need to cover fully, but they are starting to consider the CHANCE of it happening is becoming more and more likely. So for each option (remember each option is 100 shares) they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1% chance of it happening. But this very act may CAUSE it to happen.

At some point, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because MMs are 'insuring' their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up, the price actually goes up, which means they need to insure even more, which creates a snowball effect. All the way up to, or beyond, the last option, which is at strike price $800.

Similarly, the MMs probably considered it about maybe 5% likely that GME would hit 300 this week, but now it's more like 95% like, which means for each option contract with STRIKE 300, they will be buying 90 shares BEFORE the price hits 300 (which means about a million shares bought, which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place!) They do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in AFTER the price reached PAST 300 (then they will DEFINITLY make a loss). At least if they buy in BEFORE the price reaches $300, they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses.

Remember, all parties are TRYING to make money, but not all of them succeed. So MMs are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days, and looking at the above table, this will likely push the price towards, and likely over $800 either this week, or next week.

You can also see in some particular numbers there's a LOT of shares that need to be covered, expect a lot of action when we APPROACH those numbers (for example, $300, $350, $400, $420, $500 and of course $800) as you can see, some of those numbers are close, and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point.

# This is only the GAMMA SQUEEZE. Now what about the short squeeze?

Some people ask: ""Why don't the shorts just wait for the rally to be over, and buy when the price drops back to normal levels?"" Simple answer: they can't. Melvin was already down 53% the last time and they didn't even cover (that was just a gamma squeeze, by their own words). When a hedge fund has a short position, they can keep that position, as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves. If the price of the asset they are short increases drastically (like in the event of a gamma squeeze), they will be FORCED to buy. As an example, let's say Hedge Fund M has $100 billion worth of assets, and shorts Company G for $1 billion at $10 per share. Now the price goes to $1000 per share, so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts. This is an unacceptable risk, as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover. So they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted. However, this very act will drive up the price (if you want to know how, read up on order books and slippage, this post is getting long enough as it is).

In fact, this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy, but seeing as Melvin managed to lose 53% and still didn't cover, it seems likely Melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses, and will ACTUALLY go bankrupt. This will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses. The clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble (I'm pretty sure that's illegal). So the clearing houses would cover IMMEDIATLY, regardless of costs. Even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air. So TL;DR, it's a short squeeze because the shorts are FORCED to buy back their shorts, one way or another. Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares (while only about 50 million or fewer are available) this will be ""name your price"" kind of prices. This is where $100k is NOT a meme.

# IMPORTANT LAST POINT:

**Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next, there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future. Remember, it doesn't cost us anything to HODL, but it does cost them a lot to SHORT. Every day they are losing MILLIONS. Every day we keep the price above $0 is a WIN for us.**

PLTR to Move from NYSE to NASDAQ: Could QQQ Addition Spark a Rally?,"**Palantir Technologies Inc.** on **November 14, 2024 filed an 8k** detailing the company's decision to transfer its stock listing from the **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)** to the **Nasdaq Global Select Market (Nasdaq)**. This move will officially take place after market close on **November 25, 2024**, with trading on Nasdaq beginning on **November 26, 2024** under the same ticker symbol, **PLTR**.

# Key Highlights:

1. **Transfer of Listing**: Palantir notified the NYSE of its voluntary decision to move its Class A Common Stock listing to Nasdaq. This change is part of the company‚Äôs strategic move, potentially allowing it to meet eligibility requirements for inclusion in the **Nasdaq-100 Index**, a move that could increase visibility and attract new investors.
2. **Regulation FD Disclosure**: Alongside this notice, Palantir has issued a press release (Exhibit 99.1) informing the public of the transfer and addressing forward-looking statements related to its Nasdaq listing, potential index eligibility, and other speculative benefits.
3. **Forward-Looking Statements**: Palantir outlined expectations about the Nasdaq listing, but also noted that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could affect actual outcomes.

This transition to Nasdaq could indeed position **PLTR** for potential inclusion in tech-focused indexes like the **Nasdaq-100 (QQQ)**, which may increase trading volume and attract more institutional investors. As of November 14, 2024, institutional investors hold approximately 45.65% of Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) stock[.](https://imgur.com/a/zrjFxK0)

Anyone excited for Nebius (Yandex) resuming trading on Nasdaq this Monday?,"Nebius, the company formerly known as Yandex that‚Äôs now focused on cloud infrastructure for AI uses (aka ‚ÄúAI compute‚Äù), is to begin trading on the public markets once again ‚Äî more than two years after the Nasdaq halted trading due to economic sanctions imposed in the wake of Russia‚Äôs Ukraine invasion in 2022.

The Netherlands-based company is vying to become one of Europe‚Äôs leading players in the burgeoning ‚ÄúGPU-as-a-service‚Äù space, and sits in a somewhat unique position ‚Äî it is a startup in many ways as it‚Äôs starting out afresh as a new business, but being a public company means that anyone can invest in it as an alternative to the usual U.S. hyperscalers such as Alphabet or Microsoft.

Founded in 1997, most people know Yandex as the ‚ÄúGoogle of Russia,‚Äù building everything from search engines and advertising products, to maps and autonomous vehicles. Yandex‚Äôs core market was very much its domestic Russia plus a handful of neighboring countries, however its parent was a Dutch holding organization called Yandex N.V. which went public on the Nasdaq in 2011, followed by a secondary listing three years later on the Moscow Exchange.

Yandex N.V. was doing well as a public company, reaching a valuation of $31 billion at the end of 2021 before the Russia-Ukraine conflict kickstarted a series of global sanctions against companies in the region, and also individuals. Yandex co-founder and CEO Arkady Volozh was forced to resign after the European Union placed him on a sanctions list, although he was removed from the list in March 2024 which paved the way for his return as CEO of the next version of Yandex N.V.

That next version is Nebius and its business is based on one of Yandex N.V.‚Äôs few remaining assets outside of Russia: a Finnish data center and AI cloud business called Nebius AI. The new entity formally emerged back in July, outlining its plans to be a ‚ÄúEuropean AI compute leader,‚Äù similar to something like CoreWeave ‚Äî a company that is also in the midst of expanding into Europe, raising a ton of equity and debt en-route.

While the Nasdaq had said in 2022 that it would delist Yandex and several other Russian-affiliated companies, Yandex appealed and the Nasdaq agreed to maintain its listing ‚Äî but keep a halt on trading as it went about severing its Russian ties. With those ties terminated earlier this year, and $2 billion in the bank from selling its Russian assets, Volozh said at the time that he intended to continue Nebius as a public company, as it was an easier and cheaper way to access capital, in what is a very capital intensive business.

‚ÄúOur ambition is to build one of the world‚Äôs largest specialist AI infrastructure businesses,‚Äù Volozh said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis requires access to technological expertise, graphics processing units and capital. These are exactly what we have.‚Äù

Nebius said its Class A ordinary shares will resume trading on Monday, October 21, 2024.",2024-10-18 11:41:16

Biggest event in March is not the Stimulus but the FOMC meeting | Nasdaq and SP500,"$1.9T stimulus has been a foregone conclusion. Everybody knew it would be passed. And though it could cause a sugar rush in a correcting market pushing it up, it's impact is expected to die down fast. Big money has been flowing out of big tech (which makes up a big % of Nasdaq and SP500) and into value and reopening plays. The stimulus is likely to make tech rally again, only for the rug pull to be imminent. I hope everyone is aware of that. Why do I say that? Because of the rising 10Y yield. The very reason tech has been draining for the past month. Just so you know, the more fiscal spend the bond market anticipates in the coming months or year, the bigger the bond sell off. It makes sense on their part because they expect all the fiscal spend is going devalue the dollar and make inflation a highly likely outcome. Inflation is the enemy of bonds. So the bond vigilantes, in anticipation of inflation in the future, is selling their holding and driving up the yield. The movement up on the yield if steady wouldn't have been a problem, as it would have been more indicative of economic growth. But the recent huge spikes are indicative of a different story boiling under the surface: inflation. Now, whether we would actually have inflation or not is not the problem here. Mere expectation of inflation is enough to make big money scared and rebalance their portfolio. If big money starts believing the inflation narrative, the impact would be observed in the violent swings of tech and equities in general.

The administration has already made it clear that they plan to big on fiscal spend in the coming years. The Fed has already made it clear that wouldn't be raising interest rates anytime soon - because raising interest rates now would mean slowing down the economy and thus making the efforts so far futile. But, things don't end here. If there is no response to the 10Y sell off, the bond vigilantes might just mount even more pressure on the yield making it push up over 1.75.

What impact does a steeping yield curve has? It makes borrowing tougher than say one year ago and also it makes tech's future cash flow discount more, thus making their current valuations unattractive.


The treasury auction due to happen this coming week is going to say a lot about the bond market sentiment. If it goes badly, it is even more worrying speaking in terms of equity volatility and the 10Y yield.

All eyes are currently on Fed and JPOW for the upcoming FOMC meeting this month. Since raising interest rate is highly unlikely and there is bound to be fiscal spend in the future (accommodated by low interest rates), it is a strong possibility that Fed might resort to Yield Curve Control to temporarily calm the 10Y yield - another term for this Operation Twist. In this unique practice of QE, rather than buying short end of the YC, Fed shifts their purchases to the long end of the YC, in order to flatten the curve and keep borrowing rates low. But, what is the cost of this? The cost of this dollar devaluation and unattractive treasury bonds.

If Fed resorts to YCC, expect equities to roar back again. If they raise interest rates or do nothing, expect equities to struggle at least in the short term, before there is some sort of stability in the long term bond market.

TLDR: Stimulus not big news for the market, will most probably be a sugar rush. Look out for the treasury auction this coming week - if bad, yield will probably spike even higher. Biggest event in March is the FOMC meting - will either make or break the market in the near term.",2021-03-07 13:24:19

"GME short interest may be over >100% - the question appears NOT IF it is over-shorted, but WHICH >100% it may be","**Thesis: GME short interest may stand at minimum 107% since January 27th. Only 35% of pre-squeeze shorts may have been covered since January 27th.**

*""It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.""-Mark Twain*

*‚ÄúWhen the rich rob the poor, it‚Äôs called business. When the poor fight back, it‚Äôs called violence.‚Äù ‚Äì The Apocryphal Twain*

**------**

**I) The Short Interest Numbers**

Short interest (""SI"") is calculated by shares shorted over total outstanding shares. *See* [*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp)*;* [*https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/shortedstock.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/shortedstock.asp)*.* Apparently other firms have used different versions of float. All other forms of float are likely incorrect, and not likely used by Finra. **This is an important assumption** \- if I am wrong here, then fuck.

**Edit** (to above): People are suggesting my float is wrong. That is exactly my point. I am using float as outstanding shares b/c we don't know what it is. If someone actually knows the float used by FINRA, post it; this post is then useless. The math working backwards from 226% is fair game, however. That's why it's possible I'm wrong (*see* [*https://www.highshortinterest.com/*](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)*)*. *See also* comment by [JeanGuyRubberboots](https://www.reddit.com/user/JeanGuyRubberboots/) below (ctrl+f). *Either way, it's remarkable that $GME on some sources is still the most shorted stock.* I want to see the actual float used by FINRA. Until then, here's the math based on the SI equation.

Total outstanding shares of GME is 69.75 million. *See* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/).

Finra SI of GME is .78 as of January 27th. *See* [*http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0*](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0).

.78\*69.75 million = 54.405m. Thus, 54.045m million shares are short GME of January 27th.

To calculate real SI, we remove insider ownership. **Another big assumption**. Insider ownership stands at 19.06m. *See* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/insider-transactions/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/insider-transactions/).

Thus, free float is outstanding shares *less* insider ownership shares. 50,750,000 shares.

**Real SI appears, at minimum, 1.07 (54.405m/50.750m).**

\----

**II) The Shorts Remaining and Covered**

On January 15th, GME SI stood at 121%. *See* [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31).

Thus, from January 15th to the 27th, we know at least 84.397m shares were shorted. (1.21\*outstanding shares).

By January 27th, 54.405m shorts remained (previous short amounts minus current shorts remaining as of 1.27). The number of shorts that covered from Jan. 15th to the 27th was was 29.992m. 29.992m/84.397m shares = \~35%. Thus, 65% of shorts pre-squeeze remain, owing APR.

Around \~35% of covering resulted in a 1,600% rise. Thus, a 65% cover rate (conservative) can yield a 2,971% rise. Let‚Äôs apply this math to now. From $50, this is a $1,485.50 GME price result. Could this happen? No idea. Notice the problem with this: I'm assuming *only* covering led to this rise. So this is simply a demonstrative point.

**New shorts from Jan. 27th to present likely opened at higher prices. 65% of those from $5, $10, $20, etc., probably remain. This is bad news for HF's.**

**III) The Effect**

Based on estimated remaining covers, price stagnation at $50 could result in further covering and collateral calls. This burden is reduced if HF's opened new shorts at the peak and they are substantially ITM. This part is unclear. We know it's very likely that HF's opened new shorts at the peak--- what isn't clear is that it was within their risk department's policy to open new shorts during a fucking squeeze. In my opinion, it wasn't until drops below <$200 the HF's felt safe opening up new shorts. This is a substantial point: if the new shorts are at much lower price points than thought, then the pain points for HF's are far lower. It's just unclear. Nonetheless, HF's may be bleeding substantially every week because of those remaining shorts.

A good counter is that borrow rates currently seem low for new positions. *See* [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME). You'd think these are correlated markets, so the most shorted stock on the market would have higher borrow rates. Borrow rates could be low because it's no longer shorted. Or because there is no volume on the stock. I'm not sure what borrow rates are for open short positions, but I imagine they're higher. I don't know more beyond this. Feel free to debate.

Moreover, consider the current liquidity and volume of $GME. It appears that retail buying power is spent. People either cashed out or are holding. So, they are unlikely to trigger the next squeeze - or a gamma one for that matter. Thus, the fighting grounds has likely gone institutional. Not all hedge funds are short $GME - nor are all financial whales. In my view, this has become an institutional fight, with both sides pointing the gun at each other, waiting who's going to pull the trigger first. Retail is simply on the sidelines, holding the clips in for both their guns (smirking, of course). How long until every chump with a few million bucks laying around realizes this is still the most shorted stock on the market before they infuse substantial buying pressure? Or I guess one Moby Dick will do it. My reservations in these predictions is that HF's are smart, they can't be fooled twice, etc., and all of that non-sense. But before intelligence comes greed. And I know greed and desperation has always governed the financial system.

**IV) Parting Thoughts**

It would take a half-brained monkey 45 seconds to crunch the short interest numbers. Yet Finra was late (posted after hours I think). This is the most shorted stock on the market according to my numbers - yet, again, **dead silence** from the mainstream media. Sources are using various versions of float to calculate SI, as if suddenly short interest is something that be manipulated based on our interests. Americans with $2,000\* in their checkings account are being investigated for stock fraud (that is, the general public and the focus doesn‚Äôt appear to be on hedge funds) and not the Big Money that loop-hole-engineered an illegal 140% naked short situation. *See* [https://fortune.com/2021/02/12/gme-gamestop-federal-probe-reddit-stocks-doj-justice-department-wallstreetbets-market-manipulation-amc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/12/gme-gamestop-federal-probe-reddit-stocks-doj-justice-department-wallstreetbets-market-manipulation-amc/); *see also* [http://www.firstamericanstock.com/index.php/articles/why-is-naked-short-selling-both-illegal-and-common-practice/](http://www.firstamericanstock.com/index.php/articles/why-is-naked-short-selling-both-illegal-and-common-practice/).

The Big Short is illustrative. It depicts how corruption and fraud has always been the building blocks of our financial institutions. Put differently, fraud doesn't just pervade the system - nay, it ***is*** the system. Everything I've seen *just doesn't feel right*. Understand at this point I'm speculating. But I trust my gut.

There are also posts suggesting OTM/ITM options are encouraging institutional price manipulations of $GME. This is beyond my knowledge span. However, if you looked at the bid-ask spreads this week of $GME, they were at times pennies apart for days. I've never seen that before. Seriously, **what the fuck.**

DFV is testifying alongside the CEO's of Robinhood, Citadel, and Melvin Capital. Next Thursday is a day to watch for me. Again $GME will be the most discussed and watched stock in America - and, arguably, the globe. Americans *and the world* will be reminded why their holdings in $GME tanked 50-90%. For many, their life savings. No, it wasn't a result of imprudent investments -- to invest money into a squeezing stock is a *good* idea short-term. It was the clearing houses pulling the plugs because *the financial system was never designed for working people to make that much money. So when the risk of you getting that rich increased, they stopped the game (pun intended)*. We don't even need to get into whether there was intentional collusion - that's just speculation, and it doesn't even matter to establish how messed up this is. But think of how this plays out: these institutions either bullshit their way through the hearing and everyone and their moms sees past it. Or they tell you the truth that, based on risk management and capital models, they never thought retail would get that rich that fast. Either way, I don't think it'll play out well for them other than DFV on national television. A key element to the public's reaction: AOC grilling the hell out of these folks. That will likely infuriate a lot of Americans watching.

And to set the record straight, I don't think retail is propping $GME at $50 because they have diamond hands -- middle America is holding because *they have nothing to lose* after the clearing houses and Robinhood tanked their portfolios by over half. **So their plan to kill off retail interest backfired.** In the process of stunting buying pressure, they inadvertently made chunks of working America diamond holders. Poetic justice - and fucking hilarious.

I'm not demonizing rich people. We all want financial freedom. I'm demonizing cheating the game. However this ends one thing is clear: The Big Squeeze is going to be an epic movie.

**TLDR: it's in the damn title.**

\--

**Disclaimer because working people are vilified when the financial system is exposed - does this sound familiar? It should because it's a reoccurring pattern. When rich people lose, poor people are blamed and we foot the bill:** I'm a random guy on the internet stating my opinions so if you take my advice to do anything without your own research, you are dumb. This DD could be garbage. If you disagree, comment below and counter me. I don't want an echo chamber. Not a GME promotion, just more DD.

$30K On UNH Calls.  Here‚Äôs Why The Stock Could Fly:,"Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).

My new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH

I have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.

In no particular order:

1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key transactions:

‚Ä¢ Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.

‚Ä¢ Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290

‚Ä¢ John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648

‚Ä¢ Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.

‚ÄúShow me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.‚Äù ‚Äî Charlie Munger

No better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.

2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)

3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn 

Furthermore, even if the case isn‚Äôt dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don‚Äôt really care.

4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:

- Covers 50 million people
- $410B in annual revenues 
- 400,000 employees
- 90,000 doctors in the network

Said differently:  Too Big To Fail.

5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.

6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.

7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.

8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.

9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).

10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else ""out of their control"".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  

I could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",2025-05-18 13:03:34

**Positions:** 11K shares at about $7. Took profits along the way, but I‚Äôm holding what I have left to see what happens.

## Shares, Ownership & Short Interest

BBBY has been buying back shares for the last few years (terrible capital allocation imo, but that‚Äôs water under the bridge) and is now down to **79M shares outstanding from 186M in 2015:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/olsk42b65qg91.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae9337fa823a6d3a0c2661bda05316a4a6f238b5

Currently, institutions and strategic entities are long **84M shares** out of **79M outstanding** \- yes, they are long more than 100% of issued shares. We‚Äôre not even talking about float here.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9shqtnw75qg91.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=363edeb45e8cfcf1e6cff1ba8ba166e0749ce708

As you can see from the blue line in the first chart above, there was one large short cover during the squeeze in Jan 2021, but since then, the short interest has been mostly flat up until July of this year at about 20M shares - despite the buybacks.

That‚Äôs from quarterly short interest reporting. Now, S3 reports that **10M shares were shorted below $7**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fo7mhoad5qg91.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=66cc9dacca854c0a0f7e6fd13f121329d3d5e490

The short thesis here, again, is bankruptcy. Admittedly, this is not an impossibility, though the higher the share price goes the less likely (given the potential to do share offerings to raise capital).

So, nutso summary here:

* **80M shares issued**
* **85M shares owned by institutions and funds**
* **30M+ shares short, with 10M shorted below $7**

## Price action on 8/8 after hours on 8/9

I was pretty attuned to the GME squeeze in 2021 having written a lot of posts as part of my EndGame series. I‚Äôm seeing many similarities in behaviors. Here are some notes:

* Shorts tended to defend the price level of 2x their entry. For GME, this was $15.8, which was defended hard a few times, and when that level was lost it was squeezetown. $15.8 represented **2x the entry price of a large quantity of shorts.** Why is this significant? At 2x the price, your short is now at **-100% and it‚Äôs very likely your risk mgmt group is going to shut you down.**
* BBBY started going on 8/8 and in particular after hours. Why did we have a 16% spike after hours? **That started at $12.** **My hypothesis is that there were a group of shorts that entered at $6 and began to get force closed at -100%.**
* Premarket at 8/9 was sitting at **$13+**. If the market opened bbby at $13+, there would have been a slew of force closures from smaller and potentially larger short entities as that would represent -100% for larger and larger portions of the 10M short shares added under $7. **It was critical for shorts to move the price down. Do or die at $13.**

## So it's do-or-die, what do shorts do?

* Selling during low volume premarket to establish downward trend
* Shorting via synthetic shorts (short calls / long puts)
* Analyst downgrades

* Potential astroturfing in WSB (low karma, low post history accounts sharing negative sentiment in daily thread)
   * A decent amount of algos follow sentiment in retail, and in addition to shorting you can astroturf social media investing sites to change sentiment
* Once BBBY hits -10%, they can‚Äôt short on the bid, so they establish sell walls to keep the price below ask (examples):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/37lifq8l5qg91.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d24eb24f35033e1eae45703a253cdd71e4ba5eb

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/05gaejgo5qg91.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=4126d9fe8c91366f36a8405f4a1ba80dc6e43ebd

Additionally, today marked the opening of a slew of strikes upward, **which is generally bearish b/c a bunch of retards tend to buy the highest strike, leading to negative pressure on the underlying when MMs later dehedge those positions.**

## Where does that bring BBBY today?

1. Shorts have won the day, turning momentum around with a massive reversal from 13+ to $9 currently
2. However, they‚Äôre still sitting on 30M shorts, and probably more after today, with 10M+ entered below $7/share. So far, this hasn‚Äôt undone the beginning of this squeeze:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4sosc4oq5qg91.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9a5b5011e344ec6b9aa557df23d3387817b49f2

Finally, short shares availability is quite low - **so there's no evidence that shorts have actually covered at all during the 5-day rally.**

&#x200B;

[Blue bars: short shares available. Red line is short borrow fee. ](https://preview.redd.it/uz4iys386qg91.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=524f21743a2735c778e44188acc1800f40be70fe)

## So what now?

The long game: The short thesis is bankruptcy for $BBBY. If $BBBY can avoid bankruptcy, the short thesis is squashed and they‚Äôll need to exit. This may not be today, tomorrow, or next month - but that‚Äôs the long game. Personally, I‚Äôm betting $BBBY finds a way to squash bankruptcy risk which will push this to a long struggle to get out for shorts.

The short game: It‚Äôs generally looking like retail is giving up the short game in the face of many strong short-seller tactics.

In my opinion, buying OTM calls just helps move the price down as MMs de-hedge, while shares reduce the pool of people that shorts can buy back from.

## UPDATE: OH SHIT.

## Just realized. BBBY short interest might be updating EOD TODAY! If that's true, that's another reason for the push down today.

## 8/9 SHORT INTEREST UPDATE 

&#x200B;

* Between 6/30 and 7/15, **Shorts added 7M shares short of $BBBY**
* Between 7/15 and 7/29, **Shorts added 500K shares short of $BBBY**
* Current official short interest as of 7/29 is **29M shares** [per Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest)
* Unofficial ORTEX estimate is at **52M shares short**

&#x200B;

**Why is that significant?** 

Let‚Äôs look at [BBBY‚Äôs price between 6/30 and 7/15](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/history?period1=1656547200&period2=1657843200&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true):

**That‚Äôs an average close price of $4.9.**

**7M shorts were added to BBBY‚Äôs short basket at an average price of $4.9.** 

BBBY is currently at $10 after hours. **7M shorts are sitting on over 100% loss.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m4bv8sub4rg91.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=09671f8cb013cbf29b2845fe233428de8687e6dd

Keep in mind in my previous post I shared that I don‚Äôt see any evidence of covering. 

Now, let‚Äôs look at [BBBY‚Äôs price between 7/15 and 7/29](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/history?period1=1657843200&period2=1659312000&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true):

**That‚Äôs an average close price of $5.08.**

**500K shorts were added to BBBY‚Äôs short basket at an average price of $4.9.** 

## Summary: Shorts R Still Fuk

So, **7.5M shares were added in a month at an average price of $5,** there‚Äôs **no evidence of covering,** and **they‚Äôre sitting on a 100% loss at current prices.** 

Yeah, I‚Äôm going to see how this all plays out.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1.) COVID vaccine rollout has started, and we will be able to attend movies soon. The Biden Administration (sorry for getting political, just pls keep reading) has an ambitious plan (100 million vaccines in 100 days or whatever the fuck) and this pandemic is almost over. I‚Äôd give it until the end of the year.

2.) **Most** [**AMC**](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-movie-theaters-reopening-0123-2021) **theatres** [**are open**](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean#locations) or they are planning to open soon with social distancing and mask measures in place. They will shut down the food services and concessions, but they are coming back.

3.) **Consumers have a sentimental connection to movies. They will come back**. People are starved for the outside world and will come out in massive hordes to watch movies. People will go out and see movies, take their kids, go on dates, etc. Nothing can replicate the experience of a giant screen and surround audio.

4.) This major influx of blue balled movie goers will cause a major boost in 2021. Then we will see a continuation of the year over year growth we have been seeing since 2012.

5.) The AMC business model is working. The revenue has steadily increased since 2012 year over year. [**In 2012, they made $811 million. In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**

6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few years with the help of their parent company, Wanda Entertainment, and increased profits in 2021.

7.) They will not go bankrupt. WANDA entertainment, a Chinese company owns the plurality share (20%) and will bail them out if it is necessary. They bought for $2.6 billion in 2012, and have seen a ROI, scoring $2.7 billion in 2013, the year immediately after their purchase. AMC is too good of an asset for Wanda to lose them. Also, AMC can take advantage of new stimulus and other government assistance programs.

8.) It‚Äôs extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there‚Äôs a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.

9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations and pay debt, using stock sales as leverage. AMC just did this today, and they can do it again if needed.

10.) AMC will not go bankrupt, not only because of the potential Wanda bailout, but [**they also raised $917 million today. They have enough runway to stay operational the end of the year. ""Bankruptcy is off the table for now.""**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/25/amc-ceo-adam-aron-on-917m-financing.html) (We should be able to return to theatres by then.) A slight majority of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.

11.) [**AMC is about 70% shorted**](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)**, there is much potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.

12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. They [have also reached a deal with Universal, which allows Universal to do home releases earlier, but stipulates they must be in theatres for 17 days before that.](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-deal-theaters-pandemic-1234801134/)

13.) AMC is only $12 a share right now... Even if it loses, you‚Äôre only going to lose a bit. Meanwhile, the ceiling is high, and there is much potential. If you want in, do it now while it's cheap. People keep talking about how dumb it is to buy during the pandemic, but this is the point of largest potential. Don't wait for the recovery to buy.

14.) AMC used to trade at $10 before the pandemic. Let‚Äôs keep it at its former glory. AMC deserved a $1bn market cap and they got one. They will probably hit $20 tomorrow (predicting $25 by Feb1, peak in summer with COVID all done.).

15.) Even though the Net income is negative and they lose money, it consistently stays in the hundred thousands range, and it does not lose that much. Any autist on here from GME could pay the difference. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)

*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*

16.) Without AMC there‚Äôs no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.

17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.

18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.

19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)

20.) **STONCCS only go up.**

21.) you guys are all retard who cannot think for themselves and will do whatever is echoed in this fucking internet cave.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR : AMC has done a great job with fundraising and can survive until the end of the year. Vaccine rollout has started, and recovery is coming soon. People are due to return to movies. About 70% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.

# Pandemic recovery & squeeze combo.

Does anyone else feel nervous as hell about making any substantial moves right now?,"Now I'm not one for risk management (or any form of management), but I am having a hell of a hard time doing anything bullish or bearish. Just hear me out:

* Gaymestronk could get cut in half or double in price in 10 minutes at any given moment
* tech stocks are bleeding like a knife wound but can have random 10% days (not to mention the hundreds of stocks with no P/E *at all* doing wild swings)
* lockdowns still doing weird shit
* gas shortage panics while michigan is trying to cut off the Canadian-US pipeline
* middle east conflicts starting up fast
* month-to-month inflation is 4.2%, fed is still keeping interest rates low as balls on a hedgehog
* memecoin values are based on hopes that a dude talks about them on a sketch show
* notable hedge funds are liquidating
* building materials are tripling in cost over the month
* and we have an actual unmet labor demand while new stimmies are being sent out

And while all this is happening, SPY is up 39%, DIA is up 39%, Nasdaq is up over 42% over the last 12 months. I don't think many people would disagree with the fact that the market is generally overvalued right now. But, if you buy puts, you can expect those to bleed out and let some market maker run off with your money while you sit there hoping for a drop (ew). But of course you know its all built on a house of cards, so a call will either bleed or get wiped on an overnight swing. Companies can beat earnings estimates by 50% and drop the next day because it's ""priced in"" and mid-market companies with a huge run up will start issuing shares the second they get the chance.

Why buying the NASDAQ-Dip is a great play,"Huge dips like these where the whole market tanks a couple percent have been happeing about once a month, i am scared right now, but this one is still no different.

This looks very much like the June 10th Dip (if you remember, this was when everyone thought the second crash is coming):

\- 1 month of consistent gains followed by a 5% drop in a single day

&#x200B;

Why will this recover ?

\- Because millions of people have been waiting for this EXACT dip to get into tech because they didnt want to fomo in at all time highs in august

\- Because Donnie will do anything to be able to say ""Record high S&P, Nasdaq, Dow"" during the presidential debates

\- Because this is a dip like any other

Nvidia‚Äôs $590 Billion DeepSeek Rout Is Largest in Market History,"ALTERNATIVE SOURCE ‚Äî Bloomberg: Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world‚Äôs largest company. 

Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company‚Äôs market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record ‚Äî a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value ‚Äî and was the biggest in US stock-market history. 

The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday‚Äôs slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3%.

The semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek‚Äôs low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. 

The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.‚Äôs App Store rankings. 

‚ÄúConcerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,‚Äù Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients.

Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren‚Äôt showing a sufficient return on the investment. 

Meta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US. 

In a bid to stall China‚Äôs progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeek‚Äôs progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources.

Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek‚Äôs model is an ‚Äúexcellent AI advancement‚Äù and indicated that the Chinese company didn‚Äôt violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, requires ‚Äúrequires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.‚Äù",2025-01-27 17:18:07

Why Elon Musk Will Definitely Sell 10% of his stock,"[https://medium.com/@jericho.k.roman/why-elon-musk-will-sell-10-of-his-tesla-shares-849e697ef3d6](https://medium.com/@jericho.k.roman/why-elon-musk-will-sell-10-of-his-tesla-shares-849e697ef3d6)

TL;DR. Elon has 14.8 billion dollars of tax due when he exercises his options (which he has to do before August 20th, 2022), he can significantly reduce the tax bill by billions of dollars by dropping the Tesla stock price. Selling 10% of his shares covers all of his taxes and leaves him roughly a billion dollars in cash to play with.  Basically, he's using Twitter to lower his taxes.

Positions: straddles.

Edit: In regards to the question by u/SaladTossgaming on getting puts: I'm thinking about it as well but concerned about IV. Also, the gamma position on Nasdaq is insane, we may be in for a parabolic run. I wouldn't be surprised if Tesla goes to 2k. Would love other's opinions on this.

Edit 2: not bullish or bearish on tesla price. Simply commenting on the selling.

Edit 3: Slightly out of context but pertaining to a question in one of the comments.  There was $450 million of ITM call buying (January 2024 $1000 strikes) in a single day last week.  That's not only a significant dollar amount but also, similar positioning had occurred prior to the SPX inclusion and share split.  Sorry if this causes confusion about what action(s) to take but it's part of the reason why I'm neither bullish nor bearish (see Edit 2). Note - option flow isn't the clearest indicator; for example, a large holder of Tesla may have had to sell their shares due to Tesla becoming too large of a % in their portfolio (required to sell per portfolio risk management), however - since they still want to participate in the upside they may have purchased ITM options to compensate for the sale.",2021-11-07 11:24:14
Why the Housing Market is Likely Fucked,"**TL;DR: Almost all the key signs that caused the housing market crash in 2008 are back stronger than ever. Mortgage debt is at ATH, consumer debt is 2x higher than ever, lumber futures are down 60% but physical lumber isn't moving, unemployment is still 50% higher than in 2009, housing starts are double what they were in 2008, and median house prices just broke $300,000 for the first time ever, inflation adjusted. All of which are bearish indicators for the economy. Houses r fuk**

&#x200B;

**1.) Mortgage Debt and Consumer Debt is at an All Time High**

Having high mortgage debt makes your house a debt and not an asset. It is sitting right above **10 trillion dollars.** If it goes any higher, we are at an extreme risk for higher foreclosures. However, consumer debt may be a greater issue. It is currently nearing **2x what it was in 2008.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**2.) Lumber Futures Have Fallen, Physical Has Not**

Another way to tell if we are in a bubble is by comparing the futures market to actual prices. When there is a large gap in these two, it usually indicates people are still willing to pay much higher prices for a large supply. It doesn't make any economical sense. People still feel that lumber is in extremely high demand, and will buy lumber (which isn't in high demand), and buy as much as they can anticipating the price to continue going up. It's artificial price increases.

&#x200B;

**3.) Unemployment is Still Extremely High After COVID Restrictions Lifted**

Unemployment numbers are still 50% higher than they were in 2019. There's no reason to go back to work for \~2% of the population, because the stimulus checks and unemployment add up to more than minimum wage. This money has to come from somewhere, a.k.a money printing. This in turn adds up to more inflation, which is my next point.

**4.) Inflation is the Highest it has been in 31 Years**

Jpow, our lord and savior, announced today inflation was above expectations of 5%. This has not happened since 1990. Hmm.

&#x200B;

**5.) Housing Starts are Double What They Were in 2008, Nearing 2005 (Peak) Levels**

Housing starts measure how many houses are being built. It is currently at around 1,500 a month. They are still recovering from 2005 but quickly approaching 2005 levels. More houses being built means that there is more supply flowing in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**6.) Median House Prices are at $300,000, Up Nearly 100% From 2012**

Although the housing crisis ended around 2009, the bottom for housing prices was in 2012. Since then, housing prices are well above their 2008 levels, even adjusted for inflation. This is a bad sign for the housing market. Having high housing prices means more debt, which leads to more defaults.

&#x200B;

**7.) 30 Year Fixed Mortgages are at an All Time Low**

This is not necessarily a bad sign for the housing economy, but it means if we were to have a recession, it could be really bad. To fix recessions, the fed usually lowers interest rates, which is like turning the economy off and on again. It works most of the time. The grey bars in this picture are recessions. Notice how about halfway through each recession, the interest rates decrease, and the recession shortly ends.

Interest rates are already incredibly low, so this may not be an option for the next recession without making interest rates negative. Having negative interest rates triggers more panic buying houses people can't afford, which results in more defaults. It will quickly become a chain reaction of hell.

This is my first DD, hopefully it's decent. I will be responding to comments.

Edit: due to the high number of comments, I will not be able to respond to most of them. I did not expect this post to get this popular. I was anticipating being called a retard (which around half of you are).

What I've learned:

1.) This housing market is not really like 2008. It's more secure today, or at least what we know is.

2.) Lumber prices really indicate a bullish position on the housing market. I was wrong about the gap between the futures and physical. I have also been told that was worded poorly.

3.) When you really put effort into a post, it does well. I spent well over 3 hours on this post, and it's the first one that hasn't been removed by the mods.",2021-07-13 23:46:04

Let‚Äôs start by looking at the popular opinions on $DJT that are making the rounds.

Bear:

- Trump Media & Technology Group does not have the fundamentals to justify its current evaluation.

- This stock is largely dependent on a single individual, Donald Trump, who is undergoing a litany of legal cases. These cases will force him to loan or sell shares of $DJT, which would likely sink the share price.

- The price is current at $60.00?! Everyone will definitely sell and I‚Äôm going to make a killing on the downfall.

Bull:

- This is Donald Trump‚Äôs company? He wants to restore free speech? I want to be a part of this, so I‚Äôm gonna buy shares.

- Donald Trump‚Äôs company just went public? This guy is the world‚Äôs #1 self-promotor & people are going to go crazy for this. I‚Äôm in.

- The price is currently at $60.00?! I can get in early and in 10 years this thing will go 10x

Like everything that relates to Donald Trump. $DJT is polarizing subject. Some would relish in seeing this thing completely and utterly fail, while others hope to see this truly succeed.

So why does this matter? If you happen to be in the I don‚Äôt GAF camp, I‚Äôm just here to make money. Then here‚Äôs why it matters, the politics of this stock has created a massive short squeeze opportunity the likes we haven‚Äôt seen since the stock who shall not be named (... ""we like the stock"").

Let‚Äôs take a look, starting with the most recent ORTEX data:

[SI Overview](https://preview.redd.it/k1hn3qhqqvrc1.png?width=3584&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c7dbf15c7638766bc500d7d8f049bc133ac4a0d)

1. the Short interest value is $278.73 million.
2. the Cost to Borrow is at 342.71%.

For those who don‚Äôt follow this kind of thing, most stocks, especially those that are widely held and traded have a relatively low cost to borrow rate, often below 5%. Stocks that are in high demand for shorting, have limited availability, or are perceived as having higher risk may have significantly higher borrowing costs. Rates above 20% are generally considered high and indicate a particular set of circumstances that makes shorting those stocks more expensive. 290.65% annual borrowing cost is far outside the norm, It suggests an exceptionally high demand to short the stock, combined with a very limited supply of shares to borrow. Here‚Äôs where things get interesting‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs take a look at how much shorts are spending daily with these numbers:

(SI \* CTB) / days per year = cost per day.

**($278,730,000 \* 342.71%) / 365 = $2,617,083 per day the shorts are paying to borrow shares & short $DJT!**

How did shorts do lasts week with these high rates and high demand for $DJT?

*Processing img 7rj9qlkubwrc1...*

They took a $95 million loss, lol!

So what are shorts doing now? Are they running for the hills? Are they declaring defeat?

*Processing img anagfj98cwrc1...*


Nope‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre doubling down. Last Thursday they borrowed over 879k shares at a borrow rate of \~ 600+%!!!

Which brings up the question. What are the shorts betting on?

It‚Äôs simple, the shorts are betting that they can get shareholders to sell based off the fundamentals of $DJT. Is this company making money? Is it worth the current valuation? The answer is no and no one would hold after acquiring these gains, right?

What they aren‚Äôt realizing here is Trump supporters are holding $DJT. The same people who after 2 impeachments, 4 indictments, Jan 6th, ‚ÄúGrab em‚Äô by the p\*\*\*\*‚Äù, $DWAC SEC investigations, <insert random scandal here>, aren‚Äôt leaving his side. They are still buying his $400 shoes [for over $450,000](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-sneakers-ebay-profits-1872111), buying 110,000 of his [$100 ‚ÄúTrump baseball cards‚Äù](https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards), and more than anything, still voting for him. These people would march through the gates of hell for Trump and would die before selling their shares. The shorts are GROSSLY underestimating to what lengths these people will go for Donald Trump.

This brings us to the crux of the situation. The shorts need to keep the price down and are throwing the kitchen sink at it. If they can‚Äôt, they will be forced to cover 4.5 million shares worth at whatever price the holders deem their shares are worth. All this while it‚Äôs costing the shorts $2,617,083 dollars per day to keep this going & it costs $DJT holders nothing. It‚Äôs quite clear which side can outlast the other in this situation.

That‚Äôs all I have to share for now. I hold $DJT shares and options. Obviously the squeeze would become more likely if investors buy shares in addition to options. Feel free to double check and correct any of my info. Good luck to everyone no matter what side you fall on. Hopefully we all can make some money on this.",2024-04-01 10:43:34

The great collapse has been in planning for years and today it will officially begin the volatility spiral,"EDIT: yes I can‚Äôt spell, and this is not financial advise!!!

Today I will do a Technical analysis on several charts showing how the dollar will rockets, gold and stocks will crumble, even oil and fake internet coins will crumble further. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to make fortunes because quite frankly its not everyday we see multi decade technical patterns break out unless your living until your a 100

to start things off, everyone knows a high dollar is bad for stocks and every asset you buy since their value is pegged to the dollar (even your fake internet coins). What if I told you the value of the dollar is about to increase by about 50% 

[Right here we have about a 50 year wedge that did a fakeout in the 2000's to the downside then pumped and broke out in 2015 and has been concolidating a double bottom since which just broke out two months ago. The price target of the wedge would indicate about a 75&#37; move up, which about 60&#37; of which is left to happen.](https://preview.redd.it/1evhipxyl5791.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=c27c94447ec2f4b85f8195b013ce0ada0ea011b0)

Im hoping to make 1000-5000% on them then ill short the vix top with spreads ITM for an easy 300% or so which should  give me a sum i can survive on until finding another job (the uvxy play is not mine as stated above) The reason I also believe this dump will trigger UVXY is because everything will go down, stocks, crude, gold and heck even the all reliable trustworthy digital real estate will be hit

$JACK recovery?  Or insolvency?,"Does anyone have thoughts or DD on this?

The 5-year chart looks abysmal. They peaked at about $120 in April 2021. Before this, on the 10-year chart (not shown bc the app says only 1 pic allowed per post), you can see long term stability (with moderate fluctuations that usually served as excellent buying opportunities).  Since April 2021, the stock has fallen to 1/6th of that value, now beneath $19/share.  If they were ever to rebound‚Äîand that‚Äôs a BIG IF‚Äîthat would be up to a 6-fold gain. 

They have a new CEO since the first one looted the company and drove it into the ground. 

They canceled their excellent dividends, which was my incentive to remain holding shares. The stock has tanked 20% since they‚Äôve done this (and that was fast, about 1 month). 

They are closing stores, I think about 5% of them. 

They bought Del Taco in 2022 and are looking to sell it in 2025 for a few hundred million in losses. 

That all sounds bad, but supposedly the reason they lost so much value is because they took on so much debt.  And these measures are debt-reducing, supposedly. 

So it may be a long term play, but does it seem like a rebound is possible or likely?  

Or does it seem like it will keep dropping and potentially go bust?  If it keeps going downdowndown, is this not a great play for Puts?

There is still much territory in the US and abroad where JACK has not expanded. Comparing to McD and Burger King, both of which are available in all 50 States and in Europe/Americas, there is tons of room for growth. But playing it right is extremely hard apparently. I am sure there is loads of brand-refinement that they can do (eg White-washing the whole brand and hiring clean young people to be more like In-N-Out) but the new CEO would rather hire T-Pain to be a spokesperson. Yes, seriously, T-Pain in 2025.

Personally, I don‚Äôt think it is going back to $120.  But it could bounce back to $40 or even up to $70. 

- when rates finally drop, debt-heavy businesses will surge, this being a prime example. 
- when they offload Del Taco or make it profitable and swallow that $400 million loss, they‚Äôll at least be on the road to recovery, even though that‚Äôs a lot of 99¬¢ tacos they‚Äôll need to sell to recover. 
- when the Ukraine war ends, in general, that will be good for the entire market. Why?  I don‚Äôt know. But the market hated the start of the war, so I presume the opposite will happen when it ends. But the end seems to be nowhere in sight unfortunately.  

Any thoughts out there?

Worth buying shares?
Worth buying calls?
Worth buying puts?

My positions are shares, about 200 average at $55, which means now I can‚Äôt even afford their tacos.",2025-06-01 12:51:09

Follow The Money - How To Catch Every Rotation And (Almost) Always Make Money,"# I. Introduction

Sorry for the wall of text - but if you are serious about trading **please read through this -** I think you all could really benefit from a bit of intermarket analysis - and I see way too many victims of ignorance here who could prevent their losses by understanding these relatively simply concepts.

This sub is primarily focused on IWM names (Russell 2000/Small Caps). If you look at that stock - **it's been sideways for almost a year**. No secret you all have been losing tons of money as of late on your favorite names (Except MVST - nice one there).

In my eyes - for the best probability of success - you always want to be playing the names that are within the strongest index at the time (or simply playing the strongest index itself). I determine which is the strongest via charting plus some simple intermarket relationships.

Last year during the recovery we got a huge **everything rally** \- that is not usually the case. Money constantly rotates from sector to sector - this is how it usually is - and how it's been for most of 2021. For instance - notice today (8/102021) tech is dropping while financials, materials and other inflation camp names are pumping. This is one of many useful correlations.

# II. The Indices

The indices are large groups of stocks lumped in together that usually move in unison. Most of you probably already know this. I'm just going to list out what each index is and what it focuses on.

**S&P 500 (SPY, SPX, ES)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&P 500, is a stock market index that tracks 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices.""

Basically a compilation of most large caps in the United States. Great gage of overall market health - and sort of a cross between the other two large cap indexes (Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones).

**Nasdaq 100 (QQQ, NDX, NQ)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Nasdaq-100 is a stock market index made up of 102 equity securities issued by 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market. It is a modified capitalization-weighted index. ""

These are going to be mostly your large cap growth names (tech stocks) - but there are a few boomer names in there. Just more heavy on the growth side than the other indexes.

**Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA, DJIA, YM)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones, or simply the Dow, is a price-weighted measurement stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.""

These are going to be your ""boomer"" names - I like to call it the boomer index. Value, materials, healthcare etc. Not really any growth names in there (except AAPL, CRM I guess). One thing I like to note is that **all the names in Dow Jones are present in the S&P 500 - the Dow is the most closely correlated index to the S&P** (about a 0.92 correlation iirc).

**Russell 2000 Index (IWM, RUT, RTY)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Russell 2000 Index is a small-cap stock market index of the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index. It was started by the Frank Russell Company in 1984. The index is maintained by FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group.""

These are all your small cap names. There is also a Russell 1000 and Russell 3000. Notice how many more companies are in here than the other indexes. This one isn't going to be moved by one or two stocks. Small caps usually benefit from risk on environments (they are perceived to be riskier) - but note the more speculative growth ones will lag in those situations.

These are also **meme stocks - pretty much every single one is in a Russell Index.** If you are someone who likes to play memes - you always want to watch IWM. When this one is popping off is when they will be making a run.

# III. Risk On vs Risk Off (Inflation vs Deflation Camp)

Moving onto more practical applications of this information. I could do a section on Forex, Bonds, etc. - but honestly you only need to know what they are to apply the analysis that I do.

The primary narrative driving the market in recent times is whether we are getting inflation or deflation - and this has dictated the flow of money.

**Risk On (Inflation Camp)**

Risk-On is described as a rotation from save haven assets into riskier assets. If market participants believe in high inflationary pressures, they will want to invest their cash into **""risk"" assets** including, stocks, real estate etc. to combat the residual effects of inflation on their money. Additionally, they believe we are now in a rising rate environment (rates already at zero, likely to increase in the future), which would help benefit **value stocks, financials/banks, energy, specific forex/currencies**, anything that benefits from low rates (currently).

More specifically, **banks benefit from a gradual steady increase in interest rates.** Banks make an interest rate spread on deposits received versus money lent. In a rising rate environment, they are able to pay lower interest on their deposits and make a larger spread on their loans.

Commodities, materials (energy), and consumer/defensive stocks **benefit from inflation** as they are able to pass on rising costs to consumers. Additionally, value/defensive stocks typically have a strong track-record of recurring dividends and share buybacks to provide yield to shareholders. Conversely, in later stages of rising rates, investors may divest from growth or tech stocks because rising rates have a direct effect on liquidity and cost of capital. **When rates are high, debt is heavier and money is more expensive.**

AUD/JPY is an easy forex pair to watch for risk on movements based on the Australian economy in relation to Japan. A**UD is seen as a ""risk"" currency**, whereas **JPY is seen as a ""safe haven""**. When AUDJPY is increasing, typically this is a sign of ""risk-on"". This is only one of many pairs to watch for in Forex Markets, considering Forex Markets are much larger than the stock market.

Remember, in the early stages of inflation, small caps or tech stocks will perform well because the negative impact of inflation on sitting in cash; however, if the federal reserve is required to combat hyper/stagflation worries, they will raise rates and growth or tech stocks may perform poorly in that environment. Furthermore, **Dow Jones Industrial Average (boomer)** names will usually outperform, and investors today may be pricing-in this effect.

Equities as a whole will generally do well in a risk-on environment. Stocks are considered a hedge for inflation, but watch-out for JPOW and his antics later on.

**Risk Off (Deflation Camp)**

This is the opposite of risk-on. Money rotates out of risk assets into safe havens. People in the deflation corner believe inflation is transitory, asset prices will decline, and virtually **assume the Federal Reserve won't have to raise rates**. In low inflation or deflationary environment, money flows **to safe haven assets out of risk assets**. Participants would hoard cash (increasing in value) and wait for asset prices to decline. They would invest in **bonds, safe haven currencies, speculate on an increase in volatility, and save cash to reinvest later.**

In recent times - growth performs well here because when interest rates are low - money is cheaper to borrow. **Growth depends on debt to continue it's operations. Most of them also don't make money and so they have** **no yield.**  An increase in interest rates will raise the cost of capital making it harder for companies to generate higher returns. With rising rates, a company has to pay a higher interest expense that lowers their overall profitability. Lower profits lead to lower cash flows, which lead to a higher required rate of return for investors, all of which lead to a lower valuation for the company's share price. Note this is primarily due to recent macroeconomic events - and in the past all equities have been considered risk on.

Bonds outperform because investors believe rates to remain low or fall further. They'd be able to receive a **""higher"" interest rate today versus in the future.** Bonds are typically safer than equity because they are first in-line in the event of a liquidation (bankruptcy) and earn a fixed rate of return. Additionally, the **USD, JPY, CHF** perform well because they are a 'safe-haven' currency. The US Dollar is still considered the world's reserve currency. (Trust in the US Economy/Risk Free) In addition, deflation has a natural increase in the dollar's value.

The VIX performs well because it's **essentially a measure of how hedged SPX players are**. If you are expecting deflation in assets - you are expecting prices to drop for the most part - and so you want to be hedged on your long positions (or make straight bear bets).

**In Summary**

Today, the Federal Reserve has created a low interest rate environment to stimulate the economy; through allowing participants to borrow funds ""cheaper"" or lower rates. This stimulates demand, supply, borrowing, lending... overall growth. Asset prices are attempting to ""price-in"" the future state of the economy.

If you believe that inflation is here to stay, then you'd want to shift into risk-assets. If you believe that inflation is 'transitory', then you'd want to move towards safe haven assets. Ultimately, you could assume that the Federal Reserve controls the narrative and that any major movements in the flow of money, cost of debt (change in rates), could have a positive or negative impact on asset prices. In either scenario (in the future), inflation can lead to higher interest rates causing a drop in asset prices or deflation worries can keep interest rates low and fuel the rally for longer than one would expect. I hope that makes sense.

<Risk-On>

* Financials
* Commodities
* Value
* Materials
* Real Estate
* **Basically Most Equities**
* AUD/JPY (AND OTHER RISK-ON CURRENCY PAIRS)

<Risk-Off>

* Bonds
* Dollar
* VIX
* Growth/Disruptor Equities (SOMETIMES - THIS IS A NEW CORRELATION STEMMING FROM COVID MAKING TECH NAMES SAFE HAVENS AMONG OTHER UNPRECEDENTED FACTORS)**

# IV. Practical Applications

First let me go over the tickers I watch for each rotation -

<Risk On>

* YM (DIA)
* RTY (IWM)
* CL (Crude Oil Futures)
* ZC (Corn Futures)
* AUD/JPY

<Risk Off>

* DXY (Dollar Index)
* ZB (30 Year Treasury Bonds)
* TNX (10 Year Treasury Index)
* VIX (The ""Fear Index"")
* NQ (QQQ)

Glancing at a watchlist of these will give you a quick picture of where money is flowing at the moment - but in order to predict the odds of future movements (and more profitable ones) - I perform technical analysis on all of these names.

Basically - I analyze all the indices and only play the one that is the strongest from a technical standpoint. I further filter these signals and determine position sizing by analyzing their correlated assets.

For instance - if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is breaking down - this is confluence for a risk on rotation. The more confluence - the higher probability you have of success in any play.

On the contrary, if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is rallying - this is a sign one of the moves is likely fake - and a signal I have lower odds of success. Subsequently, I want to size smaller.

***Let's take a look at one example in which QQQ (Growth, Risk Off) caught the rotation this past May. This is a perfect example of Bonds and Growth moving in unison to provide a high probability long trade in QQQ and TLT. Note: I just use trendlines and volume for my technical analysis. No indicators.***

QQQ - https://ibb.co/wwhXm2k

The red circle is Nasdaq on **5/13.** You can see that is the day it bottomed - and every day since then pretty much Nasdaq and Growth assets have been leading. Not only that - but on **6/22** it broke a huge technical setup (the big red line) - which triggered a ton more upside.

TLT - https://ibb.co/kyzWcsP

The red circle here is also **5/13.** You can see that is also the day that TLT (ZB or Bonds) bottomed - and every day since then except for the past three days - it's held the same uptrend. Not only that - but on **6/22** it also broke that big red line - which was a downtrend stemming from last year - triggering more upside here as well. We also broke out of that teal symmetrical triangle, which provided more confluence for the move.

I try to assign a signal strength to each move in order to make it easier for my monkey brain to understand.

* **Indexes:** 3
* **Bonds:** 2
* **Everything Else:** 1

You will see a lot of people say bonds are everything - and in my experience that is very true. Last year we had an extremely odd situation where risk parity was fucked - but in recent times it has come back. Correlations almost always revert to the mean at **some point**. Subsequently - you could watch just bonds and the indices and efficiently track the flow of money.

# V. Divergences

Correlations are not perfect. If they were - everyone would be a billionaire. There are times when we get divergences and things move opposite of the way they usually do. Like I said - they **almost** **always revert to the mean** at some point - but the catch is the divergence could blow your account before it reverts back. If you are good with technicals you can easily spot when a setup you are trying to play breaks down and stop loss accordingly - but the key point here is **always have a stop loss when playing correlations.** Lots of people think they can average down infinitely and eventually profit off the arbitrage that comes with assets reverting to the mean - but **the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.**

# IV. TL;DR

The main thing to takeaway here is the indices. If QQQ is weak - maybe you want to take a look at DIA. If IWM is sideways - maybe you want to take a look at QQQ. Keep your head on a swivel and don't be too biased towards one sector. **If you can effectively track the flow of money - you can theoretically catch every rotation.**

Also - you don't have to apply the technicals I do to track it. That's just my method. Lot's of people use complex macroeconomic analysis to assess these sorts of things, among other methods. I'm just too smooth brained for that.

I hope this helped you all - and if anyone has questions drop it in the comments.

\---

Edit: One final note since I know the more advanced people will likely comment on this. I know QQQ/Growth has not always been risk off - this is a new thing. I was trying to explain things from the perspective of recent times as correlations shift with macroeconomic changes.

We haven't had a true deflationary environment in over a decade - and subsequently the market rotations have been more about pricing in rate hikes/rate cuts than rotating in and out of equities as a whole.
